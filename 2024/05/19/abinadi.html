<a class="anchor" href="#chronology-of-kings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chronology of Kings</h2>
<p>From the assigned reading in Come Follow Me (and the Book of Mormon order), it may be hard to track the timeline from our sequential reading.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/children/resources/topics/book-of-mormon/2011-10-06-book-of-mormon-time-line-eng.pdf">Timeline</a></p>

<h3 id="zeniff-and-ancestral-land">
<a class="anchor" href="#zeniff-and-ancestral-land" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Zeniff and Ancestral Land</h3>
<p>Zeniff (around 200 BC): He led a group of Nephites from Zarahemla to reclaim their ancestral lands (Lehi-Nephi), the land where Lehi first landed. Initially, they are promised the land of Shilom.  Later they fought for their land and obtained their planned inheritance for 22 years.  Ultimately, they are taxed and enslaved by the Lamanites.</p>

<p>Noah (Zeniff’s son): He was a wicked king who persecuted the prophet Abinadi. Alma the Elder, originally one of Noah’s priests, converted to Abinadi’s teachings and fled with other believers.</p>

<p>Limhi (Noah’s son 124 BC): He was a descendant of Zeniff who eventually led his people to escape from Lamanite captivity with the help of Ammon, a missionary sent by King Mosiah II.  Limhi led his people to reunite with the main Nephite population in Zarahemla. This reign signifies an end to the separate lineage of kings descended from Zeniff.</p>

<h3 id="mosiah-i-mosiah-ii-and-zarhemla">
<a class="anchor" href="#mosiah-i-mosiah-ii-and-zarhemla" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mosiah I, Mosiah II and Zarhemla</h3>
<p>Mosiah I:  He was a prophet who led a group of Nephites from the land of Nephi, the same as the land Zeniff tried to return, to Zarahemla after they were warned by the Lord. He became the first king of the combined people in Zarahemla and was the father of King Benjamin.</p>

<p>Mosiah II: This is the Mosiah you likely hear about more often. This is the King who sent Ammon to find out what had happened to Zeniff, as a generation or so had passed since they heard any word.  He was King Benjamin’s son and the king referenced as Mosiah II in the Book of Mormon.  His reign is covered in detail in the Book of Mormon and is significant for events like the conversion of Alma the Younger and the establishment of a more Christ-centered government.</p>

<h2 id="zeniff-writings">
<a class="anchor" href="#zeniff-writings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Zeniff Writings</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Zeniff tells us of his quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mosiah 9:3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zeniff updates on the state of the Lamanites in approximately 200 BC.  How do these verses relate to you in the workplace, society or news of today?  Do you know of bitter people or people that feel the were wronged?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mosiah 10:11 … Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</p>

<p>Mosiah 10:12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zeniff unites his people and they win many battles and have a season of peace.  When can you call upon the Lord when fighting a war?  There are many stories in the Book of Mormon regarding the battles of the wicked versus the righteous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mosiah 10:19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</p>
