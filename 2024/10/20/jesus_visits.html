<h2 id="entropy">
<a class="anchor" href="#entropy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Entropy</h2>

<p>We are all fallen, and through Jesus Christ, we can claim all of the glory of the Father. Today we may feel great in our path to follow the example of Jesus. But I caution you about entropy.</p>

<p>I moved into this Ward in the year 2000. Having a young family, we focused on a pool, trampoline, rough scape, and garden. It was perfect. Between that and having gardeners, we had many years of <strong>perfection</strong> in our yard.</p>

<p>At some point, we decided to cancel our gardening service, as surely roses were trimmed incorrectly and they seemed to be imperfect in weed removal. Surely, we could do things better ourselves. This year, as we looked around while preparing for summer primary pool parties, we were alarmed at the state of affairs.</p>

<p>Entropy is a measure of how much energy is lost in a system. If a system loses too much energy, it will disintegrate into chaos. Our gardening focus seemed to wane over the years. Many plants and ground covers seemed to be beyond hope. This would take a lot of energy to fix. To stop the chaos, it seemed it would take an extreme amount of time and ability, taking away from our ability to enjoy or accomplish other things. Then my wife said, <strong>Let’s start by filling up the greenery can every week.</strong> We still have a ways to go, but on Saturday, October 19th, 2024, I see hope for the area around the pool again.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the gospel, I have felt that entropy or energy loss. Many years ago, before Shay was born, perhaps it was my wife again, we decided to read scriptures every night. Also, when Tiernan returned from his mission, we got out of the habit of <strong>butts on bed</strong> prayers to <strong>knee</strong> prayers. Additionally, at some point, I started personal prayer in the car and then silence as I drive to work. Also, just coming off of Conference Weekend, this is an event that I try to never interrupt. I try to treat it like the <strong>big game.</strong> These are my proverbial actions to “fill up the greenery can.”</p>

<h2 id="praise-to-the-lord">
<a class="anchor" href="#praise-to-the-lord" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Praise to the Lord</h2>

<p>Thinking of the filling the greenery can in manageable chunks, let’s read some scripture.</p>

<h3 id="3-nephi-1110-11">
<a class="anchor" href="#3-nephi-1110-11" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 Nephi 11:10-11</h3>

<p>Highlight: Jesus Christ introduces Himself to the Nephites and declares His mission.
Scripture: “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father <strong>in taking upon me the sins of the world</strong>, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.”</p>

<h3 id="3-nephi-1248">
<a class="anchor" href="#3-nephi-1248" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 Nephi 12:48</h3>

<p>Highlight: Jesus teaches about perfection and following His example.
Scripture: “Therefore <strong>I would that ye should be perfect</strong> even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.”</p>

<h3 id="3-nephi-1815">
<a class="anchor" href="#3-nephi-1815" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 Nephi 18:15</h3>

<p>Highlight: Jesus emphasizes the importance of prayer to avoid temptation.
Scripture: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, <strong>ye must watch and pray always</strong>, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.”</p>

<h3 id="3-nephi-1925-26">
<a class="anchor" href="#3-nephi-1925-26" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 Nephi 19:25-26</h3>

<p>Highlight: The disciples are filled with the Holy Ghost and purified.
Scripture: “And it came to pass that <strong>Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him</strong>; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold, they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.”</p>

<p>3 Nephi 27:27:
Highlight: Jesus sets the standard for His disciples.
Scripture: “And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, <strong>which shall be just</strong>. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.”</p>

<p>The Lord, in scripture, often talks about taken care of the garden.  How do we nourish ourselves?  How do we nourish the garden?</p>

<h3 id="helaman-142-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#helaman-142-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Helaman 14:2-3</h3>

<p>Highlight: Samuel prophesies the signs of Jesus Christ’s birth.
Scripture: “And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day. Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and <strong>this shall be unto you for a sign</strong>; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.”</p>

<h3 id="helaman-157-8">
<a class="anchor" href="#helaman-157-8" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Helaman 15:7-8</h3>

<p>Highlight: Samuel speaks of the Lamanites’ conversion and steadfastness.
Scripture: “And behold, <strong>ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it,</strong> that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them—Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.”</p>

<p>Highlight: The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again
Why are we building temples at such an unprecedented pace? Why? <strong>Because the Lord has instructed us to do so</strong>. The blessings of the temple help to gather Israel on both sides of the veil. These blessings also help to prepare a people who will help prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord!</p>

<p>As the prophet Isaiah prophesied, and as memorialized in Handel’s Messiah, when Jesus Christ returns, “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.”</p>

<p>In that day “the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, <strong>now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior</strong>, Jesus the Christ. Now is the time for us to make our discipleship our highest priority. In a world filled with dizzying distractions, how can we do this?</p>

<p>Regular worship in the temple will help us. <strong>In the house of the Lord, we focus on Jesus Christ. We learn of Him. We make covenants to follow Him. We come to know Him.</strong> As we keep our temple covenants, we gain greater access to the Lord’s strengthening power. In the temple, we receive protection from the buffetings of the world. We experience the pure love of Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father in great abundance! We feel peace and spiritual reassurance, in contrast to the turbulence of the world.</p>

<p>Here is my promise to you: <strong>Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ will find Him in the temple.</strong> You will feel His mercy. You will find answers to your most vexing questions. You will better comprehend the joy of His gospel.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, the Lord will comfort you too! He will strengthen you. <strong>He will bless you with peace, even amidst chaos.</strong></p>

<p>Highlight: Blessins and Miracles bestowed on the faithul.
So many wonderful things are ahead. <strong>In coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior’s power that the world has ever seen.</strong> Between now and the time He returns “with power and great glory,” (Joseph Smith-Matthew 1:36), He will bestow countless privileges, blessings, and miracles upon the faithful.</p>
