## Jesus Lives 
> We solemnly proclaim that God loves His children in every nation of the world. God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, <mark>Jesus rose again</mark> and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer.

### Testimony
> I like everyone has a story.  My story is that I came to earth, just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live.  My excitement to this story is that <mark>I am a child of God</mark>. That my birth entitled me to a divine spirit! I firmly believe we all have a divine spirit that directs us in every major decision and thought.  In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine gift.  Shortly after, in my 19th year I spent two years serving the people of England.  I had many days walking down roads unknown and often taught that "God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, he learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return".  I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of the restoring truths in England.  Today, 40+ years later,  I continue in that spirit and truth.

### Life
> I have had 5 wonderful children.  My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience.  We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children.  Tamara left this earth at age 42.  My first 3 children and I suffered.  In my darkest moments as a father, I felt the presence of the Savior.   I had visits from him in dreams from and he presented to me my deceased wife Tamara and others.  I needed the comfort of those tender experiences.  Two years later, raising a family alone, I looked across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and saw someone familiar.  Once again, love returned to my life as I discovered Lora, a blended family and my first biological son.  As with Job, in adversity "I know that my redeemer lives" and that "the latter end of my life has more than my beginning". <mark>Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives</mark> and personal and divine connection; I continue as child of God.
