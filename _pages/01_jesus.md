## Jesus Lives 
> We solemnly proclaim that God loves His children in every nation of the world. God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, <mark>Jesus rose again</mark> and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer.

### Testimony
> I have a story.  My story is that I came to earth; just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live we all share an earthly experience.  My excitement, to this story, is that <mark>I am a child of God</mark>. That my birth, entitled me to a divine spirit! I believe we all have a divine spirit and it directs us in every major decision and thought.  In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine potential.  Shortly after, my 19th year, two years were spent serving the people of England.  There were many days walking down roads unknown and several opportunities to teach that "God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return".  I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of the restoring truths and saw the advent of others tuning to their divine spirit. Today, 40+ years later, I continue with those witnesses and that spirit truth.

### Life
> I have had 5 wonderful children.  My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience.  We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children.  Tamara left this earth at age 42.  My first 3 children and I suffered.  In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior.   I had visits from him in dreams and he presented to me my deceased wife Tamara as risen, as well as ancestors gone before.  At the time, I needed the comfort of those tender experiences.  Two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life ... I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and saw someone familiar, Lora.  Once again, love returned to my life with Lora, a blended family, and my first biological son.  As with Job, in adversity "I know that my redeemer lives" and that "the latter end of my life has more than my beginning". <mark>Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives</mark> and many personal and divine connection; I continue as child of God.
