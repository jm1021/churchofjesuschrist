## The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
> We solemnly proclaim that God loves His children in every nation of the world. God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, <mark>Jesus rose again and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer</mark>.

### Testimony
> I like everyone has a story.  My story is that I cam to earth like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live.  The excitement to my story, as well as everyone that has ever lived, is that <mark>I am a child of God</mark>. That has entitled me to a divine spirit! I firmly believe my spirit has received direction in every major decision and thought.  In my 18th year, I became converted to keeping in tune with tha divine gift.  On my 19th year I taught that gift to the people of England.  Several days I walked down a road unknown and taught that "God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In this vision, he learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return".  I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught then and as I have lived in that spirit these last 40+ years.

### JohnTheBloggers Life
> I have had 5 wonderful children.  My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience.  We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting cancer, and adopting children.  Tamara left this earth at age 42.  My first 3 children and I suffered from that loss.  In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior and had visits from him in dreams from and he presented to me my deceased wife Tamara.  Two years raising a family alone, I looked across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple.  Once again, I found myself in love with Lora.  This brought a blended family and my first biological son.  As with Job, in adversity "I know that my redeemer lives" and that "the latter end of my life has more than my beginning".  Through all, their has been a clarity that Jesus Lives and that my have a divine connection a child of God continues.
