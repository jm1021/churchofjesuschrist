    <li>The very act of trying to have God in your life will turn you away from evil.  Our disposition to do evil will go away.</li>
    <li>Or, the very act of looking to increase our own testimonies will bring the spirit.  We may see many turn away from the scriptures, but with the spirit increased as we read the scriptures we can prevail.</li>

3 ... I purpose to do unto them; that they may ""return every man from his evil way""; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and aBaruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord’s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.

27 ¶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, ""all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not"".

32 ¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the ascribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and ""there were added besides unto them many like words"".

  <p>Sometimes I think the Old Testament is weird.  But, a big thing I have received in this round of study is seeing sacrifice and covenants.  Our oldest scripture, unite very well with our modern revelation. Jeremiah speaks of covenants.
