How Great Thou Art . I struggle with pure Psalm reading, so I am always looking for new connections. As I make these connections, my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change. Not by just through reading, but by trying to connect to them in other ways. In Sabre Spring history, one Sunday, we had Alex Boye visit us and proclaim and testify of this Psalm/Hymn. As he sings, imagine this at our chapel pulpit. Also, follow along with the words on the page. Compare with the Psalm, Alex Boye accompanied by Mark Smith. . Psalms 8 How Great Thou Art . 1 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; | 1 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder; Consider all the works Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed!, | . 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! | 2 When thru the woods and forest glades I wander; And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur; And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, | . 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: | 4 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation; And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration; And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art! | . Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! . As a ward, many of us were uplifted by my exposure to “How Great thou Art” by Alex Boye. In my study, to understand that the inspiration for the Hymn came from Psalm 8 can really connect me back to the ancient believers. It also reminded me of my daughter, Claire, getting invited to a special fireside that night by Alex Boye; it was and is an amazing connection across modern culture to 2500 years ago. . Modern Psalmist . I love our Tabernacle choir. Conference with the choir, finding Mustache guy and debating about the four armed Organ player are part of our families conference tradition.

The Judgments of Job, by Joseph Brickey, director of the Beaux-Arts Academy, resides in Lindon, Utah . Theme and Picture . Read the statement Yet Will I Trust in Him which is the lesson theme. What does this theme me to you? | Focus in on the image of Job talking to friends. Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends? | . . Job Part 1: Tragedy of Job . Job is a life known for overcoming trials. . Job 1:3… His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. | Job 1:6-12, according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat. Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships. | Job 1:14-19 the hardships start to happen. Theatrical adaptation to these versus in our reading. After each hardship we will have a (reporter) and the save (survivor) who says… “I only am escaped alone to tell thee”. | . 1st reporter … The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 2nd reporter … The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 3rd reporter … The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 4th reporter … Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. | . That is a lot to deal with, fortune and family in a seemingly short period of time. . Job Part 2: Recovery of Job . Job 2-41 is a whole bunch of poetry. More on the lamenting, and praising in the these books of Job is below. | Job 42:10,12-13,16 in the end, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Except children seem the same (why not twice as many children?) And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. | So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. | He had also seven sons and three daughters. | After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. | . | . Conversation between the Lord and Satan . The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary. . A former Lesson plan speaks about reading Job 1:6-12 in the roles of (Narrator, the Lord, and Satan). Let’s do it! | . The Script . Narrator: Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Whence comest thou? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: Doth Job fear God for nought? | Satan: Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. | Satan: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. . | Narrator: So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. | . The narrative indicates that Satan goes forward and inflicts trials on Job. Satan is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary”; these verses in Job 1 use the form hassatan, meaning “the adversary,” which describes the satan’s role here. . Much of this could be illustrative for us, as the reader. | The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering. | Any thoughts on this dialog? What do we think about it doctrinally? | . Background on the Book of Job . More on the Book of Job The book of Job has received much literary acclaim. | Why do the righteous suffer? | Questions arise, was Job and actual man? In scripture Job was an actual man and is referred to as a great prophet… Noah, Daniel, and Job exhibited great righteousness. | Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses). Perhaps as old as 1800 B.C. | How old was Job when he died? | . | . Reading Poetry in the Old Testament . I think Old Testament books when you get to Job and beyond are hard to read. The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings. While we are reading we are experiencing and thinking across boundaries ot time. Boundaries of perspectives. Come Follow me has an inserted section stating.. - Repetition of thoughts, parallelism, poetry - Hebrew language, different culture, different thoughts - According to my analytics Worm / Worms has 11 references in Job. Huh, worms!, Job 25:6 . Tennyson has been quoted as stating that the book of Job is “the greatest poem of ancient or modern times.” Of course, Tennyson was a poet… . And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers, &quot;&#39;Tis the fairy Lady of Shalott.&quot; . I am not Tennyson, but a Computer Scientist. Thus, I need to slow down with poetry. Fast with Code, but poetry requires cross references for me to see all the BITS of wisdom. You must analyze each word in the STANZA,POEM,DOGGEREL,CODE 😀. . Job 14:14-15 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. | Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. | . | Doctrine in Covenants 29:43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; | . | Mosiah 16:8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ. | He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. | Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil— | If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation | . | . My Top 4 poetic perspectives from Job . Job as indicated by picture is in dialog with his friends for the majority of the book of Job. For me, over the years I have highlighted a few items. As we have read it again as a family these still resonate with me… . Are you listening Job 7:17 | Worldly thinking Job 21:15 | Spirit in Man Job 32:7-9 | I know Job 19:25-26 | .",

My reflections of the Ancients to today were completely unified as I look toward the spirit. In Deuteronomic period of history, we see so much crisis; today we see similar crisis.

Their topics began with our understanding of God. A lot of their talk is supplemented by early Christian thinkers. These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted my re-understanding and my relationship with God … Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings.

Additional notes: God is collaborative in other words we participate. Moses 7:29 Enoch ask how can God weep. God is weeping, while seeing his children suffer. This is a reformation of how we should view God, merciful and kind. Macrina The advance of the soul is through God’s love. Julian of Norwich And I was answered in my understanding: ‘It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.’ In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it. | . | Universalism, the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions … In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God … my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity.

In short, They have offered you everything! God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you. | And third, know the truth related to your conversion. The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you. Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life. You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe. | . | For those that have experience with the Temple… What is the focus of the Temple in our relationship with God? Understanding our relationship with God? Understanding the nature of God? How do we learn to love the Lord through the temple? | History, Stories, and Miracles in Joshua and Judges . As I read these stories, I often want to know more about the archeology, history, and details that verify these events. Things like the Ark of the Covenant, the Levite Priests, the Bugles, and the “facts’ around them are fascinating to me. Usually, I think about Indiana Jones when I think of the Ark and this fantasy leads me to Wikipedia and its linked sources to explore and Journey into the past. Here are the stories that fascinate me… . Children of Israel Cross Jordan Joshua 3:13,15,17 | The Walls of Jericho Joshua 6:2-6, 6:20 | Ambush at Ai, Joshua 6:14-21 | Trumpets and Lights of Gideon versus the Midianites Judges 7:16,20-21 | Samson and Delilah, is this scripture/history? Judges 16 | *** Why did the children of Israel keep falling int idolatry aka People after Gideon I have heard it said that our children today have such a hard time, I have seen it and felt it personally. This goes to them “Lest we Forget” . As far as evidences of these stories, there are as many opportunities to believe or doubt, even the Children of Israel doubted. Here are some things that we should understand as we read these stories… . These books belong to the tradition of Jewish history and law, called Deuteronomic, they were first committed to writing about 550 BCE, during the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Ezra is contemporary with this time of this compilation. For reference, the time period of Joshua is closer to 1400 BCE. | The death of Moses is recorded in Deuteronomy 34, the death of Joshua is recorded in the book of Joshua 24. Many of the events we have today were created from either oral histories or fragments. | Scholars, Archeologists and others often differ in opinion on cities like Jericho and Ai and how their destructions reconcile with being at the time of Joshua. | Come Follow Me suggests finding gems. It describes these books as being referred to as “Historical” portions of the Old Testament. Thus, some of these stories can be gruesome, troubling, or just from a single perspective. Come Follow Me Source: Thoughts to Keep in Mind | Be aware that Joseph Smith and his work on the Bible. The big changes in Joshua are referring to the “True Attributes of God”. The Contribution of the JST to the Old Testament Historical Books The KJV reads, “For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly” (Joshua 11:20). The Prophet changed it to read, “For it was of the Lord to destroy them utterly because they hardened their hearts.” | . | The Story of Rahab . Joshua 2 Before the Israelites cross the Jordan, Joshua sends men to scout out the land. Arriving in Jericho, they decide to spend the night at the house of the harlot Rahab. When Jericho’s ruler tries to apprehend them, Rahab hides them and then helps them escape, thus saving their lives. In return, she and her household are spared the destruction of Jericho and Rahab and her family become part of the people Israel. . Rehab’s Purpose . Rahab’s Faith, Works . Rahab in the ancestry of Jesus . My interpretation of Rahab’s example… God saves, atones and loves those with a past. Brother Darcy provided amazing insight on his feelings into this atoning process. He understood that in his work in education within the prison he saw hunger, compared to his work in traditional work in education where he sees complacency and a focus on credit hours. Lives are often best changed with a reawakening, we don’t necessarily need to be a harlot or be in prison, but whatever prison we shackle upon ourself, we need to awaken unto God and use the quickening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. .",

            "content": "Easter, The Atonement of Jesus Christ . He Lives. Today we stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ, of his Resurrection, and the fulfillment of the Atonement. . | Josiah Drew on Good Friday and our experience Friday under full moon in Laguna Mountains and Kitchen Creek . | Jesus Lives . | Insights from Tad Callister on “The Infinite Atonement” coupled with Come Follow Me “Though His Atonement” scriptures . Satan has been successful in diverting much of the Christian world’s attention from the one doctrine that can save us, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to the ancillary doctrines that have meaning only because they draw their sustenance from this redeeming event. Like a skilled magician, Satan’s every move is to divert our attention and dilute our focus from the primary object at hand, namely Christ’s atoning sacrifice, in hopes we will turn exclusively to doctrines of secondary and far lesser import” (page 15). | “In the pre-mortal council the Savior covenanted with the Father to perform the Atonement. . . Based on that pledge or covenant we had faith in him. Based on that covenant the Father could promise remission of sins prior to the atoning sacrifice because he “knew” his Son would not fail. The issue was not that he could not break his covenant, but rather, that he would not” (page 74). Abraham 3 read verse 24. 25, 27. | So what is the Atonement, and why was the Fall of Adam and Eve so significant, even vital? Eve Moses 5:9–12, Were it not for our transgression… We never should have had seed | Never should have known good and evil | The joy of our redemption | The eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient | | Elder Callister state the purposes of the Atonement … To restore all that was lost in physical and spiritual death | To provide the opportunity to repent and overcome spiritual death | To allow us the potential to become a god or goddess. | | . | “The Savior observed every spiritual law with undeviating exactness apparently because of his compliance with each one, he received power upon power until he acquired the attributes of God, even in premortal ties. Such progress was a natural consequence of his exacting compliance. His godhood thus seemed to result not from a creation of these laws, but rather from compliance with them” (page 301). Moroni 10:32:33 shares how we become holy and without spot, which is the covenatn of the Father through Christ. | It is infinite in the blessings it bestows. The blessings of the Atonement extend far beyond its well-known triumph over physical and spiritual death. Some of these blessings overlap; some complement and supplement each other; but in the aggregate the effect of this event so blesses our lives in a multiplicity of ways, both known and yet to be discovered, that it might appropriately be said to be infinite in its blessing nature” (page 60). Romans 8:35-39 in life or death nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. | “One does not speak lightly of the Atonement or casually express his appreciation. It is the most sacred and sublime event in eternity. It deserves our most intense thoughts, our most profound feelings, and our noblest deeds. One speaks of it in reverential tones; one contemplates it in awe; one learns of it in solemnity. This event stands alone, now and throughout eternity. . . . “I now add my testimony to the many who have preceded me that his sacrifice was indeed an infinite and eternal Atonement” (pages 334-335). Doctrine &amp; Convenants 19:15-19 I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. | . | Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness By Sharon Eubank . Christ heals wounds. When tragedies overtake us, when life hurts so much we can’t breathe, when we’ve taken a beating like the man on the road to Jericho and been left for dead, Jesus comes along and pours oil into our wounds, lifts us tenderly up, takes us to an inn, looks after us. To those of us in grief, He says, “I will … ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, … that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.” | Christ is rest. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said: “It is not intended that we run faster than we have strength. … But [in spite of] that, I know … many of you run [very,] very fast and that [the] energy and emotional supply sometimes registers close to empty.” When expectations overwhelm us, we can step back and ask Heavenly Father what to let go of. Part of our life experience is learning what not to do. But even so, sometimes life can be exhausting. Jesus assures us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Christ is willing to join with us in the yoke and pull in order to lighten our burdens. | The Lord knows how hard you are trying. You are making progress. Keep going. He sees all your hidden sacrifices and counts them to your good and the good of those you love. Your work is not in vain. You are not alone. His very name, Emmanuel, means “God with us.” He is surely with you. | Christ sees us in our tree. For various reasons, we don’t feel accepted or acceptable. The New Testament shows the great efforts Jesus made to reach out to all kinds of people: lepers, tax collectors, children, Galileans, harlots, women, Pharisees, sinners, Samaritans, widows, Roman soldiers, adulterers, the ritually unclean. In almost every story, He is reaching someone who wasn’t traditionally accepted in society. Luke 19 tells the story of the chief tax collector in Jericho named Zacchaeus. He climbed a tree in order to see Jesus walk by. Zacchaeus was employed by the Roman government and viewed as corrupt and a sinner. Jesus saw him up in the tree and called to him, saying, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.” And when Jesus saw the goodness of Zacchaeus’s heart and the things he did for others, He accepted his offering, saying, “This day is salvation come to this house, [for] he also is a son of Abraham.” | . | .",

            "content": "Quentin L Cook | Personal Peace in Challenging Times | Oct 2021 | Faith To Act . 2021 Oct Sunday Morning Conference Talk . Youtube Video . . Think of a current challenge, think as Joseph Smith thought O God were art thou. Read as individual or pair … Doctrine and Covenants 121:1 | Doctrine and Covenants 121:7 | Be prepared to answer, what do I expect in adversity? | Doctrine and Covenants 121:45-46 | . | As we rely on Jesus Christ … do we believe all that is unfair in life can be made right through Jesus Christ Quentin Cook comments on the lack of civility | What is an example of how you make right the lack of civility through the atonement of Jesus Christ? | What power do you use to withstand the moment? | . | Excerpts from Q. Cook 5 highlights First Love God - Post WWII by George Albet Smith, “reminded the Saints of the Savior’s invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies”. What do we think today as Russia invades Ukraine? Elder Holland, there is a quote that says “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” | Second Seek the Fruits of the Spirit - “will pitch our tents toward the temple”. This was reference to Lot and Abraham actions after parting ways and dividing land. In adversity, how do we avoid resentment? avoid the false coping strategies? | Third Excercise Agency to Choose Righteousness - “agency is at the heart of personal growth and experience”. How do we act in challenge? “all that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ”. My heart mourns for post missionary service and those that feel like they can’t recover from failing in their agency. Or members, who ultimately get to the Temple and suffer because of post Temple covenant breaking. My Testimony, I have experienced problems in my personal agencency because of “unfair circumstances”. Things can be made right throught the atonement. | Fourth Build Zion in our Hearts and Homes - “religious observance can “unleash the power of families … to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith.” I believe the pandemic was an opportunity for the Church to follow the prophet on “home-centered, church-supported religous observance”. As I have returned to school and have sat in equity, avoiding microagressions, and all lives matter type of meetings … It is my opinion, that our tolerance and love needs to increase, but also are covenant observance needs to be able to withstand all. I believe we live in a time similar to when Abraham was looking for 50 great souls to unite with him in faith and with God. Ultimately he could only could worship as a family. | Fifth Follow the Current Admonitions of Our Prophet - “feel enduring peace and joy, even in turbulent times”. I find it intrguing that Elder Cook says “Current Admonitions”. In turbulant time we don’t want to be Lot’s wife, perhaps that could be looking back at old admonitions by old prophets. Also, we need to feel joy and look ahead. Thoughts? | . |",

Thus, the need to get the plates. | . | What do the scriptures say about time of creation and genealogy of man? The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD. According to genealogies many biblical purest say Adam is 6000-10000 years old. | 2 Peter 3:8 … one day is with the Lord as a thousand years … | Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days … And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time. … | D&amp;C 77:6 speaks of temporal existence … the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence… W. W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | . Revelation continues, Restoration continues . Everyone will always be left to grapple between Wisdom of the World versus Wisdom of God. But the Gospel and Faith enable us to obtain continuous and pertinent revelation, even enlightenment if we study and ask. There are four accounts of creation in our scriptures 3 accounts, plus the temple. Abraham account says … ““We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.” | Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.) | Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed. | Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fullness. | In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man … And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth … Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. | . | .",

          "content": "Jesus Lives . We solemnly proclaim that God loves His children in every nation of the world. God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, Jesus rose again and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. . Child of God . I have a story. My story is that I came to earth; just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live. We all share an earthly experience. My excitement, to this story, is that I am a child of God. That my birth, entitled me to a divine spirit! I believe we all have that spirit and it directs us in every major decision and thought. In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine potential. Shortly after, my 19th year, two years were spent serving the people of England. There were many days walking down roads unknown and several opportunities to teach others something familiar, that “God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return”. I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of these restoring truths and observing others tuning into their divine spirit. Today, 40+ years later, I continue proclaim that same witnesses and that same spirit truth resides within each of us. . Continue in Faith . I have had 5 wonderful children. My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience. We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children. Tamara left this earth at age 42. My first 3 children and I survived, but suffered. In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior. I had a visit from Jesus in my dreams and he presented to me that my deceased wife Tamara had risen, as well as certain ancestors gone before. At that time, I needed the comfort of these tender and miraculous experiences. After two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life … I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and seeing someone familiar, Lora. Once again, love returned to my life, it came with a blended family, and my first biological son. As with Job in the Old Testament, in adversity “I know that my redeemer lives” and that “the latter end of my life has more than my beginning”. Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives, many divine connections, and always a continuing faith as child of God. .",
