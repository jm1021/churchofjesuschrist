The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD. According to genealogies many biblical purest say Adam is 6000-10000 years old. | 2 Peter 3:8 … one day is with the Lord as a thousand years … | Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days … And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time. … | D&amp;C 77:6 speaks of temporal existence … the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence… W. W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | .

Abraham account says … ““We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.” | Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.) | Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed. | Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fullness. | In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man … And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth … Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. | . | .",
