            "title": "“Preserved by His Marvelous Power”",
            "content": "Resources . August 26–September 1:: “The Rock of Our Redeemer” Helaman . | August 19–25: ““Preserved by His Marvelous Power”” Alma 53–63 . | . . Captain Moroni’s Epistles . Reference: Alma 54:5-14; Alma 60 . Captain Moroni is renowned for his passionate and direct letters, particularly those directed at Amalickiah and Pahoran. His epistles reflect a profound commitment to his people’s freedom and a willingness to confront perceived threats to righteousness head-on. . However, modern readers might find his fervor almost too intense, perhaps even unsettling when considering today’s more “inclusive” and “unity” approach. For example, his letter to Pahoran in Alma 60 is filled with frustration, accusations, and a call to action against perceived corruption. This reflects a deep zeal for righteousness, but in contemporary contexts, such a direct and confrontational tone might be seen as problematic or overly aggressive, likely leading to more negative responses or conflict rather than resolution. . . Captain Moroni had to deal with a lot! How did he react when he heard about Pahoran and the rebellion at home? . As a missionary many years ago, we talked about “dusting your feet.” Mob behavior can be in our own midst. . Pahoran’s Response . Reference: Alma 61 . Pahoran’s response to Captain Moroni’s accusatory epistle sets a remarkable example of patience, humility, and forgiveness. Despite being wrongly accused by Moroni of neglect and betrayal, Pahoran responds with kindness and understanding, explaining the true situation of internal conflict he was facing. . For anyone struggling with feelings of anger or frustration—like road rage—Pahoran’s response serves as a standard of how to approach such situations with calm and grace. Rather than reacting with defensiveness or hostility, he diffuses the situation by providing context and maintaining a “spirit of unity”. . . Pahoran is instantly the reader’s hero. However, some of the solutions to dissenters, such as capital punishment, could be perceived as over the top. . On the other hand, in many of the wars with the Lamanites, we hear of attackers throwing down arms and declaring an oath of peace to earn freedom. . I have heard many say that they can’t believe in a God who had communities of people killed that opposed the Israelites. It seems like there were many alternate scriptural solutions to wars and rebellions in scriptures. Why? . Stripling Warriors’ Mothers . Reference: Alma 56:47-48 . The faith of the Stripling Warriors, a group of young, valiant soldiers, was indeed a direct reflection of the teachings and examples set by their mothers. These young men, described as having “never fought, yet they did not fear death,” attributed their unwavering faith and courage to the assurances their mothers had given them that “God would deliver them.” The influence of their mothers was so profound that it became a central theme in their success and survival in battle. . This story emphasizes the powerful role of righteous mothers in shaping the spiritual and moral fortitude of their children. Their example of faith and testimony provided a foundation that carried these young warriors through extreme challenges. . . Some of us did not have mothers who were great role models. I was raised by a divorced mom who often prioritized her Hollywood lifestyle. However, there was typically something about my mom that seemed to appreciate my choice to follow what she termed as “Mormonism.” . Others of us may sometimes feel like we fall short in our roles as mothers or fathers. Parenting, I have heard, “is the great experiment.” How do you feel today about your parenting skills? . Helaman and Descendants . Reference: Alma 53-58; Helaman 5:4-12 . Helaman, who led the Stripling Warriors, is remembered not just for his leadership during their battles but also for his continued influence through his descendants. He guided the “little army” with faith and strategic wisdom, ensuring their preservation and success against overwhelming odds. . His descendants played crucial roles in the Reign of the Judges, facing significant challenges like political intrigue, bands of robbers, rejection of the prophets, and the pride and disbelief that plagued their society. Despite these challenges, they remained steadfast in their duties, embodying the same faith and leadership that Helaman had demonstrated. . . In life, we may never know about the success or failure of our future generations. As I recall the teachings of my ancestors that I have researched through family history, I often feel a need to honor their past. I like how the Book of Mormon refers to King Benjamin, Amulek, and Zeezrom much later, after many generations. It gives me great hope for my future generations, through the traditions of Jesus Christ and the family values that I try to establish. . Amalickiah, Ammoron, Gadianton . Amalickiah, Ammoron, Gadianton: Power, Greed, or Grievance? . Amalickiah, Ammoron, and Gadianton are often depicted as villains driven by power and greed. However, a closer examination of their actions and declarations reveals that they often claimed to be wronged, using these grievances to justify their actions. . Amalickiah . Reference: Alma 48:1-2; Alma 51:8-9 . Amalickiah’s ambition to become king is clear, but he justified his actions by framing himself as a victim of Nephite leadership. After defecting to the Lamanites, he stirred up the Lamanites by convincing them that they had been wronged by the Nephites. He manipulated the situation to create a narrative of injustice, rallying support for his cause by claiming to be fighting against the oppression of the Nephite government. . Ammoron . Reference: Alma 54:16-24 . Ammoron, Amalickiah’s brother, continued this narrative of grievance. He sought to avenge the death of Amalickiah, which he portrayed as a grave injustice. His letters to Moroni reveal a deep-seated belief that the Nephites had wronged his people, using this as a justification for his war efforts. . Gadianton . Reference: Helaman 2:3-8; Helaman 6:18-24 . Gadianton, the leader of the Gadianton robbers, also framed his actions as a response to perceived injustices. The Gadianton robbers saw themselves as an oppressed group fighting against the Nephite society, which they viewed as corrupt and unjust. Their secret combinations were formed with the belief that they were reclaiming power and wealth that had been unfairly denied to them. . . We have many groups in society that feel that they have a cause. Many, believe as the Book of Mormon people that these wrongs have been for generations. We have seen individuals like Ammon, service to King Limhi, that went to serve those that were considered potential enemies. What is our call in this world of societies declaring they were wronged, for generations? . We may be quick to see all these “bad figures” as evil. But, we may be “missing the people” behind the “bad people” that have good intentions. Or, we may not see the “bad people” behind the “good people”. Do we think every German in WWII was bad? Or do we think every Jew was good? . Listneing to Grievances . Reference: Helaman 5:17-19 . The Book of Mormon offers examples of different approaches to dealing with those who feel wronged. For instance, Ammon’s service to King Lamoni and his people shows an approach of empathy and understanding, even toward those considered potential enemies. Instead of meeting hostility with hostility, Ammon’s approach was to serve and minister, which led to reconciliation and mutual respect. . Another example can be found in the story of Nephi and Lehi, the sons of Helaman. Nephi gave up his judgment seat to preach to the people, recognizing that their spiritual needs were greater than their political or judicial needs. They preached with great power and authority, converting many and bringing about peace through their Christlike example. . . In today’s world, where many groups declare they have been wronged for generations, the example of Ammon and Nephi suggests that our response should be rooted in empathy, understanding, and service. Rather than dismissing these grievances, we are called to listen, serve, and seek reconciliation, just as they did. This doesn’t mean compromising on righteousness but rather finding ways to address grievances in a Christlike manner. .",

The this chapter, contining with Adam, tells us we have “the ligth” to combat “the darkness”, our gift of enmity . 56 And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves, and I have given unto you another law and commandment. . 57 Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time. . 58 Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children, saying: . 59 That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory; . 60 For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified; . 61 Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things; that which knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment. . 62 And now, behold, I say unto you: This is the plan of salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time. . 63 And behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me. . 64 And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. . 65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. . 66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. **This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; . 67 And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. . 68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons.

From the assigned reading in Come Follow Me (and the Book of Mormon order), it may be hard to track the timeline from our sequential reading. . Here is a Timeline . Zeniff and Ancestral Land . Zeniff (around 200 BC): He led a group of Nephites from Zarahemla to reclaim their ancestral lands (Lehi-Nephi), the land where Lehi first landed. Initially, they are promised the land of Shilom. Later they fought for their land and obtained their planned inheritance for 22 years. Ultimately, they are taxed and enslaved by the Lamanites. . Noah (Zeniff’s son): He was a wicked king who persecuted the prophet Abinadi. Alma the Elder, originally one of Noah’s priests, converted to Abinadi’s teachings and fled with other believers. . Limhi (Noah’s son 124 BC): He was a descendant of Zeniff who eventually led his people to escape from Lamanite captivity with the help of Ammon, a missionary sent by King Mosiah II. Limhi led his people to reunite with the main Nephite population in Zarahemla. This reign signifies an end to the separate lineage of kings descended from Zeniff. . Mosiah I, Mosiah II and Zarhemla . Mosiah I: He was a prophet who led a group of Nephites from the land of Nephi, the same as the land Zeniff tried to return, to Zarahemla after they were warned by the Lord. He became the first king of the combined people in Zarahemla and was the father of King Benjamin. . Mosiah II: This is the Mosiah you likely hear about more often. This is the King who sent Ammon to find out what had happened to Zeniff, as a generation or so had passed since they heard any word. He was King Benjamin’s son and the king referenced as Mosiah II in the Book of Mormon. His reign is covered in detail in the Book of Mormon and is significant for events like the conversion of Alma the Younger and the establishment of a more Christ-centered government. . Zeniff Writings . Zeniff tells us of his quest. . Mosiah 9:3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land … . Zeniff updates on the state of the Lamanites in approximately 200 BC. How do these verses relate to you in the workplace, society or news of today? Do you know of bitter people or people that feel the were wronged? . Mosiah 10:11 … Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men. . Mosiah 10:12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea; . Zeniff unites his people and they win many battles and have a season of peace. When can you call upon the Lord when fighting a war? There are many stories in the Book of Mormon regarding the battles of the wicked versus the righteous. . Mosiah 10:19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face. . Noah and the coming of Abinadi . From Zeniff to Noah there is a transition. The leadership in the transition from father to son became just like those they formerly fought against. Do we fear this of our country, leaders, our church? . Kingdom is conferred on Noah and he is unrighteous and burdens his people with tax. The King, his court and Priest are idolitrous, unchaste, wine bibblers, and use taxes to build ornate buildings. Lamanites start to attack in small numbers. . Mosiah 11:1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father. . Mosiah 11:3 … And he laid a tax of one-fifth part of all they possessed … . Mosiah 11:19 … they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood … . Abinadi come to preach. Twin Peaks Video . Mosiah 11:20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger. . Mosiah 11:21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies. . The Priest of Noah’s court are confounded. What meaneth on something that may seem obvious. It is great to see the US military performing humanitarian aid this week in Gaza. Is that the meaning of the scripture “publisheth peace, good tidings of good”? . Mosiah 12:20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying: .

Mosiah 13:28 I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish … . the Law of Moses served a purpose to remind people of God. Honestly, I have never been able to handle simple instructions. I thank the Lord for living in a time where I can learn and grow through mistakes, repent, and receive the Atonement’s blessings. . Mosiah 13:30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God . The doctrine of being redemed in God is an amazing blessing of the plan. I praise God and his Son Jesus for the redemption opportunity. . Mosiah 13:32 … for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God. . The intercession refers to Jesus acting as a mediator between humanity and God. How do you/we experience intercession of Jesus? . Mosiah 14:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. . Mosiah 15:8 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men. . Mosiah 15:9 … standing betwixt them and justice; … satisfied the demands of justice. . These words seem mighty, they provide guideance to hear the words. What does it mean “that they are his seed”? . Mosiah 15:11 … whosoever has heard the words of the prophets … . Mosiah 15:12 … these are they whose sins he has borne; … to redeem them from their transgressions … . Mosiah 15:13 … I say unto you that they are his seed. . Abinadi answers the Priest . Initially, “beautiful feet” might suggest performing good deeds. However, these verses offer a richer understanding. It is more than just physical actions; it refers to a complete devotion to Jesus Christ and his teachings. These individuals dedicate their lives to sharing the gospel and helping others receive the blessings of the Atonement. . Mosiah 15:14 And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth! . Mosiah 15:15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet! . Mosiah 15:16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace! . Mosiah 15:17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever! . Mosiah 15:18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people; . There are times in my life when I’ve felt focused on outward actions, performing acts according to my initial understanding of “beautiful feet.” However, these verses remind me to strive for a deeper conversion, one where my heart and soul are turned towards Jesus Christ. By focusing on sharing his teachings and living a Christ-centered life, I can contribute to the message of peace and ultimately rely on his Atonement for true consistent, and constant happiness. . Mosiah 15:22 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection. . Mosiah 15:23 They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death. . Alma believes, Abinadi Slain . As a returned missionary, I often reflect on the impact of my service. Abinadi, a prophet in the Book of Mormon, provides a powerful example. Though he seemingly only converted one person in King Noah’s court – Alma – his testimony continues to inspire us today. . Mosiah 17:2 But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, … . Mosiah 17:4 … And he being concealed for many days did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken. . Abinadi Seals his Testimony. Abinadi’s courage in facing death for his beliefs is a powerful example for missionaries. Just as Abinadi faced fear, we may also hesitate to share our faith. Perhaps we fear rejection, or social awkwardness. However, Abinadi’s story reminds us that our testimony of Jesus and the Gospel is worth any sacrifice. . Mosiah 17:20 And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death. . Ammon finds Limhi years after Abinadi . Ammon is sent by Mosiah II to find the people that went to the land of Lehi-Nephi. Ammon, after wondering for 30 days, took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem to the land of Nephi. . Mosiah 7:6 And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king’s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison. . After two days in prison, the were brought before King Limhi, the mystery of the people of Zeniff who left Zarahemla is revealed. . Mosiah 7:9 … Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people. . Mosiah 7:10 And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate? . Ammon replies to the King . Mosiah 7:13 For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land. . Limhi relates their fate . Mosiah 7:15 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. … our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites. . Limhi declares repentance and words of Faith. It is interesting to me in this backwards journey that the rich become worldly and that those in bondage turn to God. . Mosiah 7:19 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God… . Mosiah 7:20 … it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage. . Mosiah 7:26 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ. . Mosiah 7:33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage. . A record of descendants of Zeniff, dialog on Seer . Diligent Record Keeping. Even the people that left Zarahemla were diligence in keeping records. . Mosiah 8:5 And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them. . Limhi describes a journey where his scouts found evidence of a fallen civilization. These plates, later identified as Jaredite, serve as a testament to an ancient people who once inhabited the land. . Mosiah 8:9 And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold. . The Significance of a Seer. This is significant because it foreshadows the translation of the Book of Mormon. The passages describe the role of seers, who possess the divinely given gift of the interpreters to translate ancient records. This concept lays the groundwork for how Joseph Smith, a modern seer, would translate the golden plates. . Mosiah 8:13 .. for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer. . Mosiah 8:16 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God. . Mosiah 8:17 But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known. . Mosiah 8:18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings. . Tale of Wisdom . We learn of wisdom as being a property that humanity tends to avoid, particulary when rich. Also, we learn that wisdom has a female gender. . Mosiah 8:20 .. how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them! . Mosiah 8:21 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest. .",

I went to Tucson to see my Aunt and Cousins from my Mother’s hometown community of Binghampton in Tucson. . We had a great weekend to reflect on our family and history. In fact, as a note to San Diego residents, my Mom’s early childhood community was founded by a member of the Mormon battalion, Erastus Bingham Jr. It was eventually settled by him and his son Nephi Bingham and his wife Elizabeth Dalkin. We spent time at the Binghampton Ward, Binghampton Community, and Binghampton Cemetary. . Aunt Audrey, through marriage and other circumstances, is not regularly participating with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My faithful and faith-filled Aunt married a Catholic and has participated with several other Christain Churches and charities. Aunt Audrey remains to me a Saint and faithful daughter of God. All the things she says to me will spiritually capture my attention. . In the Binghampton cemetery, my Aunt commented to me about the negative feelings she hears or sees regarding the Cross and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. . Brother and Sisters, I respect the Cross and consider it a great religious symbol and of key importance to me and many of those in Christian faiths. It is part of the Infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ. It is part of my stepdad’s and Aunt’s faith. It is a part of me, though I have never worn a cross. Somehow the cross, through my family has snuck its way into the Binghampton Cemetary. I am an advocate of my family’s traditions and am glad to see the cross on my Mother’s headstone. . The preferred symbols used in representing Jesus are His prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane and the Resurrected Lord in the Christus statue. We have a unique symbol of the Angel Moroni that adorns the top of the temples. Inside temples and churches, we have Gospel Art. This art can contain images of Christ on the Cross. Google will show art with crucifixion related to the Church. . The atonement is power over sin and death. It leads us to overcome the death, and grave and reach towards our advocate who is the Living Christ. Jesus’s atonement includes His death on the cross. . Isaiah sees The Lord . Nephi, Jacob, and Isaiah all testify of Christ. Each feels bolstered by the powerful testament that Christ visited them. . 2 Nephi 11:2 .. for he verily saw my Redeemer . 2 Nephi 16:1 … I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne … . 2 Nephi 16:5 … for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts. . 2 Nephi 16:5 …thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. . Thanks to Nephi, Isaiah’s writings . 2 Nephi 11:2,3 . Nephi’s diligent efforts to write the words of Isaiah, as mentioned in 2 Nephi 11, have often resonated with me deeply. I’ve found profound depth in his writings, and Isaiah’s writings at times, I’ve even felt that Nephi’s revelation to do so has impacted me in unexpected ways. . March 2, 2024, as I prepared for a Sunday School lesson, I felt a sense of trepidation about discussing this subject. Yet, as I delved into Isaiah’s prophecies and contemplated the Holy One of Israel, Immanuel, Jesus Christ, and His Atonement, the Spirit overwhelmed me with inspiration. . I’m compelled to share a profound experience I had in a dream, which remains vivid in my memory to this day. In this dream, I stood on a terraced road amidst a hill, surrounded by others. From a distance, I saw the figure of the Savior walking towards us. . As He drew nearer, many affirmed His identity. While some around me fell in fear, I was filled with a profound spiritual feeling and remained standing. . The Savior acknowledged me as He passed by. . In that moment, I was overcome by a profound sense of grace, mercy, and love. It felt as though initial self-judgment had transformed into a day filled with overwhelming compassion. . Gazing upon Him, I felt a deep connection and understanding of His atoning sacrifice. . While this dream may seem surreal to some, its impact on me has been undeniably real. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of faith and the boundless love of our Savior. . I believe that if I can have such an experience, then surely many others should seek and obtain their own confirming experiences of Jesus and the Atonement if they have not already done so. . Mountain of the Lord, Temples . 2 Nephi 12:2,3 There is a pattern that the Lord reveals in the top of mountains, or in our modern case the temple. . At one period of time, every week, for over a year I felt a bolstering of Spirit as I raced to and embraced the Lord’s covenants. . Make Speed, evil good and good evil . 2 Nephi 15:19 . Contextual Contrast: The negative tone in the surrounding verses serves to emphasize the importance of seeking divine guidance and wisdom (verse 19). It highlights the contrast between those who are immersed in sin and vanity (verses 18 and 20) and those who earnestly seek the counsel of God. . or . Highlighting Irony or Hypocrisy: Verse 19 may highlight the irony or hypocrisy of those who, despite their sinful ways, still call for God’s intervention or revelation. It could be interpreted as a sarcastic portrayal of individuals who disregard moral principles yet still expect divine assistance. . Verse 19 by itself. . A call to action. Urging individuals to move swiftly and diligently in their work or endeavors related to the Holy One of Israel. . Uniting one’s will with God. The mention of ‘the counsel of the Holy One of Israel’ suggests a desire for divine guidance and wisdom, implying a plea for the alignment of one’s own will with that of God’s. This interpretation views the passage as a prayerful surrender, seeking for one’s will to become aligned with the Lord’s will, and asking for His counsel to be revealed or made known.” . A request for a vision. Expressing a longing for the manifestation of God’s power and presence. The phrase “that we may see it” implies a desire for tangible evidence or revelation of God’s workings and intentions among His people. . A request for revelation. The passage might be understood as a call for clarity and understanding regarding God’s plans and purposes. The phrase “that we may know it” suggests a longing for insight and revelation into God’s will and designs for His people. . A call for action in-order-to bolster one’s faith. It could be seen as a prayerful request for both swift action and divine guidance, acknowledging the importance of human effort while also recognizing the need for God’s wisdom and intervention, as such gifts are the foundation of faith. . Wonderful Counselor - Culture . 2 Nephi 19:4 . Often we think of ourselves as broken, reaching for the atonement of Jesus Christ. This yoke seems reversed, perhaps a cleansing through Christ and the ultimate broken yoke. . 2 Nephi 19:6 . The Messiah became a part of my life through music almost every Christmas I was married to Tamara. I miss being cultured. . Google . 2 Nephi 19:21 . The message an love of the writing of Isaiah comes down to the Savior and his hand of justice and mercy. .",

            "title": "Come and Partake of the Fruit",
            "content": ". 1 Nephi 1–5 . 1 Nephi 6–10 . “Focus in”, on the Fruit . Topic reminders and questions from 1 Nephi 1-10 . As we talk today, I want us to think of the Love of God and how the Spirit speaks to you. . There are six questions with scriptures below, pause when the Spirit speaks to you. Think of and potentially share what the Spirit says to you about the Love of God. . Q1 Turn to the Lord . I can gain and strengthen my testimony as I turn to the Lord. What does it mean to you to “turn to the Lord”? 1 Nephi 2:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers. | . | . Q2 God’s will . God will prepare a way for me to do His will. How do you know when you are doing God’s will? 1 Nephi 3:7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. | . | . Q3 Important stories . The word of God is “of great worth”. What records do you feel are dear to you and your family? 1 Nephi 4:13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief. | . | . Q4 Family lineage . The plates identify Lehi as a descendant of Joseph. Do you know your lineage? Why is it important? 1 Nephi 5:14 And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine. | . | . Q5 Frankly forgiving . We can forgive others. Have you ever felt a transformation by forgiving someone? 1 Nephi 7:20,21 “frankly forgive”. 20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me. 21 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father. | . | . Q6 God will reveal truth . God will reveal truth to me by the power of the Holy Ghost. What is your quest for revealed truth? 1 Nephi 10:19 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round. | . | . Tree of Life . Dreams can be Visions . 1 Nephi 8:2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision. | . Any path to the Love of God can be accompanied by trial . 8:5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood before me. . | 8:6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him. . | 8:7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste. . | 8:8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies. . | . The Love of God . 8:12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. | . The Word of God leads to the Love of God . 8:19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood. . | 8:20 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; . | 8:24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. . | . Nephi’s reflection includes “fell down” . 30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree. | . My Thoughts / General interpretation . The prophet, Lehi in this case, seems to have a direct encounter with a divine figure (the man in the white robe) who guides him through a dark and dreary waste. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for a prophet’s journey, often filled with trials and tribulations, but guided by divine revelation. . The people, on the other hand, follow a “strait and narrow path” along a “rod of iron” to reach the tree. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for adherence to religious laws and principles (the rod of iron) that guide people towards the Love of God (the fruit of the tree). The fact that they “cling” to the rod suggests a reliance on these principles to navigate through the “mist of darkness”, possibly representing uncertainty or the challenges of life. . The phrase “until they came forth and fell down” could be interpreted in different ways … . Humility: Falling down before partaking of the fruit of the tree could be seen as a sign of humility. In our religious traditions, bowing or falling down is a common gesture of reverence to the divine. This could be meeting Jesus and glorifying being in his presence. . | Being weary: Alternatively, it could also symbolize the exhaustion or weariness from the journey along the “strait and narrow path”. The journey to the Tree of Life is not described as an easy one, and the act of falling down could symbolize the difficulties endured along the way. A moment to glory in one’s accomplishment. . | . It’s important to note that these ending experiences are not mutually exclusive. The act of falling down could be seen as both a sign of humility and a divine acknowledgment of the hardships endured on one’s spiritual journey. . My Thoughts / Personal Interpretation . Hold to the Rod, March 6, 2016. This is a vision or story that had a deep impact on Lehi and Nephi. It too has had an impact on me… When I am right with God I feel the joyous taste and the need to direct my family to the same. I also have felt disappointment and sorrow when they don’t appear to follow. It can weaken me and may weaken my hold, but today as I read I further resolve myself to covenant and taste the good fruit. . Great story… Many things to think about… The bottom line is to keep the commandments! . Today, January 21, 2024. My focus is on the love of God. The glory of the fruit has been my focus. This week I have been in counseling with parents at school, regarding their children. I am grateful for the love of God that helps me in my journey. Everyone has the same trials, the love abounds for us all. I see perspective and eternity in all my children. I believe the love we receive will bless our children and the people we interact with in our journey. . One eternal round in the 1 Nephi 10:19 interpretation signifies that everything we do has a great purpose . The depth added with 1 Nephi 10:17-19 . 17 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God—and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come—I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of hold as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men. . Aug 29, 2012. Nephi understood his right to the wisdom of God. He understood he could have what his Father had. He just needed righteousness, faith and the Holy Ghost. We study scripture, look to examples, or even to our ancestor’s stories to understand our capabilities and entitlements. The next few verses written by Nephi further my thesis. . | 18 For he is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him. . | 19 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round. . Jan 21, 2024. The plan is always focussed on the eternal Love of God. The Savior is so involved as we cling to the rod. The gifts we receive from the fruit are eternal, eternal life is God’s life. It is glorious for us now and forever. The spirit has taught even me, to focus in on the fruit. As we are positive in the Love of God, we change our closeness to God, then our children benefit, and our new nature flows into the world. . | .",

            "title": "Introductory Pages of the Book of Mormon",
            "content": ". Introductory Pages . Happy New Year . Resolutions? . I felt very blessed to remember the life of Jesus Christ during the Christmas season. But, as a resolution, perhaps being excited about a year of study centered on the Book of Mormon can count. . Last week the Bishop introduced the BOM a bit, here are my recordings. My observation during the CFM study, these questions were in the lesson. . What is the Book of Mormon? . Another testament of Jesus Christ . | A book with a promise of personal conversion . | A book with the ability to learn more about Jesus Christ, to understand his atonement and other personally impacting doctrine . | A book that promises the Gift of the Holy Ghost . | . What would be missing in my life without the BOM? . The day I knelled to ask God if it were true. . | The miracles of personal revelation. . | The process of reading the BOM and changing my life. . | Understanding the power of God the BOM reveals, even the Holy Ghost. . | . Does anyone have any **immediate thoughts about the Bishop’s comments? or the BOM?** . Title Page of BOM, the Title Page is Translated . An Account ** written by THE HAND OF MORMON ** . Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift of God. . An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ. . TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, Jun. . Look at the BOM in different ways . How do we actively engage with the scriptures, apply the teachings to our lives, and recognize the relevance of the Book of Mormon to our journeys? . Read these scriptures by yourself or with a neighbor. Think about “how you will look at the BOM in different ways this year?” . Title Page “to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers, and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever” . 2 Nephi 1:14: “Awake! And arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of all the earth.” . 2 Nephi 33:10-15: Nephi’s concluding words emphasize the power of the scriptures to speak from the dust. . 2 Nephi 4:15-16: “For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.” . Helaman 3:29-30: “Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked—And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.” . Questions . What do you think of father and dust references? Who are the fathers? The references to “father and dust” in 2 Nephi 1:14 and the concept of awakening from the dust can be explored further. Discussing the symbolism of dust, its connection to mortality, and the importance of remembering and honoring the “fathers” in the context of the Book of Mormon narrative can provide insights. . What does the passover remember? Could that make you look at the BOM differently? Exploring the significance of the Passover and its connections to the Book of Mormon narrative can deepen the understanding of the scriptural context. Discussing how the Passover serves as a remembrance of God’s deliverance and covenant with His people might bring new perspectives to the study of the Book of Mormon. . What does it mean to liken the scriptures unto yourself? Do you think the BOM authors are trying to pull you into their stories? Why? Encouraging readers to share their personal experiences with the Book of Mormon can create a powerful atmosphere of testimony and reflection. Members can share moments when they felt the divine influence of the Holy Ghost while reading the Book of Mormon or instances where they witnessed the power of God in their lives. . Witnesses . The BOM inserts and history provides a lot of emotions and testimonies regarding the BOM. . 3 Witnesses (Oliver, David, Martin) . Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen. . 8 Witnesses (4 Whitmer’s, 3 Smith’s, Hirum Page) . Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it. . Emma Smith Statements . Emma Smith, the wife of Joseph Smith, provided some accounts of how Joseph translated the Book of Mormon. It’s important to note that there are different accounts, and Emma’s recollections are among them. Here are a couple of statements attributed to Emma Smith regarding the translation process: . Emma Smith’s 1856 Statement: . In an interview with her son Joseph Smith III and others in 1856, Emma provided the following account: . “In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.” . This description aligns with the use of the seer stone in a hat as part of the translation process. . Emma Smith’s 1879 Statement: . In an interview with her son Alexander Hale Smith in 1879, Emma gave a similar account: . “The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen tablecloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book.” . Emma’s description here provides insight into her physical interaction with the plates and her perception of their characteristics. . Translation Process, Urim and Thummim . The use of seer stones and the Urim and Thummim in the context of religious traditions involves seeking divine guidance. . Seer Stones: Seer stones, as mentioned in the context of Joseph Smith and the translation of the Book of Mormon, involve the use of a special stone or crystal through which a seer receives divine revelation. According to historical accounts, Joseph Smith used a seer stone, often called the “Urim and Thummim” in the context of the Book of Mormon, to aid in the translation process. . Urim and Thummim: The Urim and Thummim, as mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, were associated with the high priest’s breastplate and used for seeking divine guidance. The exact nature of the Urim and Thummim is not detailed in the biblical text, but they are considered a means by which the high priest could inquire of the Lord and receive answers. . Exodus 28:30 states: “And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim,** and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart when he goeth in before the Lord: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually.” . Associated with the high priest’s breastplate. | Used for seeking divine guidance. | Aaron, as the high priest, bears the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually. | . Abraham 3:1,4 Abraham had the Urim and Thummin. And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord’s time, according to the reckoning of Kolob. . Abraham had the Urim and Thummim. | The Lord, using the Urim and Thummim, revealed information about Kolob and its relationship to the Lord’s reckoning of time.- | . In all cases, whether seer stones or the Urim and Thummim, the interpretation revolves around the idea of using a designated tool to seek divine communication or revelation. The emphasis is on the sacredness of the process and the belief in a connection between the individual (or high priest, or Father) and the divine, facilitating a channel for guidance and insight. . All involve using a designated tool to seek divine communication or revelation. | Emphasis on the sacredness of the process. | Belief in a connection between the individual (whether a seer, high priest, or prophet) and the divine. | Facilitation of a channel for guidance and insight. | . What is your interpretation of seer stones and the Urim and Thummin? . Translation Joys and Hiccups . Participation in the divine brings joys. Life and interests can get in the way. . The BOM was translated by the gift and power of God, when the gift was taken the translation stopped. . Oliver Cowdrey Account: In a letter to W.W. Phelps, published in the March 1835 issue of the Latter Day Saints’ Messenger and Advocate, Oliver Cowdery recounted his experience as Joseph Smith’s scribe. He described the joy and excitement he felt as he participated in the translation process. Cowdery expressed his gratitude for the privilege of being a witness to the miraculous work of translation. He said, that through transparent stones formed as spectacles, Joseph was able to read in English the reformed Egyptian Characters that were engraved on the plates. . David Whitmer’s Account: David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, mentioned in various interviews that there were interruptions during the translation process. In one account, he spoke about a specific incident where Emma Smith, Joseph’s wife, became frustrated with the work and temporarily took the manuscript. According to Whitmer, this interruption was due to domestic issues. . Martin Harris’s Account: Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses, also mentioned incidents where interruptions occurred during the translation. He spoke about losing the 116 pages of the manuscript, which led to a period of time when the translation was put on hold. He also spoke about Joseph having the Urim an Thummin and using a seer stone for convenience to translate. . A New Year and the BOM . By discussing individual approaches to studying the Book of Mormon for the upcoming year can inspire other members to set personal goals and strategies. This is a light the world activity. In fact, in ministering or other discussion with members or non-members invite participants to share their plans for meaningful study, prayer, and application of Book of Mormon principles in their lives. . Here are some questions for our discussion. What personal experience do you have with the BOM? Testimonies? Witnesses of the gift and power of God? . Do you have a first prayer or divine witness? Is it centered around the BOM? | Do you have a teaching experience where someone received a witness of the restoration or the BOM? A missionary experienc?** | Do you have experiences with divine messengers (in dreams)? Or, people in your life that were there at the point of obtaining a testimony of the BOM? | Do you have an approach for the New Year in reading the BOM? An approach, that you believe will help you communicate with the divine more fully? | .",

            "content": ". Revelation 1-5 . Revelation 6-14 . Christmas . Best Intentions #LightTheWorld . Best intentions sometimes mess up. The month of November was full of resets on my service plans. . Train Day. I was trying to “serve” my Father-in-Law, but the room setup did not work out the way I expected. Sorry, Roy, Tiernan, Shay and others. Service should not be by my parameters. . Thanksgiving with my Daughter. I tried to give gas money to my daughter during Thanksgiving with the intent to have a fun visit. Sorry Claire… I will try to keep sickness to my own time. . Church Talk. The day after we took Shay to emergency and the day after he had bacterial meningitis. Service plans, work, and the world seem to stand still in this type of crisis. . God is love, family is love. We will finally get back to our Train day this afternoon, thanks to the service to me by Lora. Claire came and visited in a time of need, she provided me with service. Shay overcame and is back on his feet, thanks to many many tender mercies of the Lord and service by Nurses and Doctors. . Revelations 2 (God Provides, cross reference 1 Nephi 8 &amp; 11) . Tree of Life and a new name. These blessings sometimes are thought of as beyond the world. But we can have the blessing of the knowledge of the tree of life now. . 7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. . 17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. . Revelations 7 (Temple Blessings) . Promised blessings flow to those who choose to remain faithful and follow the Lord. The Temple is central to overcoming. The pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God. D&amp;C 97:15-16 You will feel God’s power. D&amp;C 109:13 You will learn words of wisdom. D&amp;C 109:14-15 . 13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? . 14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. . 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. . 16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. . 17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. . Revelation 12 (War in Heaven, cross reference to Moses 4:1-4) . Revelation backtracks to talk about the plan, before it talks of the 7th seal. This is foundational to our knowledge. . 7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, . 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. . 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. . 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. . Revelation 14 (7th Seal, cross reference to D&amp;C 4) . A Marvelous work is the start of the 7th Seal. . 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, . 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. . 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. . 13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. . 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. .

            "content": ". Thanksgiving Sunday . A time of thankful reflection. I am thankful for this moment to discuss “Giving to the Lord” . Praise be to the life of Jesus Christ. That we are able to glory in Thanksgiving through his grace | I am thankful to God and Christ that I can be in our SHARED Holy Place, our Ward and City. | . In the news of Ukraine and Gaza, we are SO blesssed to be living in a place of amazing weather, resources, and peace. . Giving to the Lord . Feelings of respect. These are a few observed acts of service I observed from former weekly acquaintances. Observations that I miss from those that have passed, but who cemented grand memories in me with their lives.. . Kristan Kelly. My memories service memories of Kristan, her glow and observing her service and companionship to Diane Harrington. . | Jack Swain. My memories of Jack are watching him gather on Spring Meadow Lane with David Tew on his way to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot. Jack love to talk about this transformitive period in his life. . | Carl Moberly. My memories of Carl were watching him hike from Poway road to his home after transporting to work on the bus. I perceived this as a means to give to his family. . | Brad Wishoff. Tamara had an aunt who was our same age. He grew up in LA, like me and we did not have a single sports team we agreed upon Dodgers for me, Angels for him. Brad joined the Church against family traditions. . | . Acts of Kindness . I came across an act of Kindness, a card with many signatures addressed to my son who was serving in Afganistan December 2011. This was a card thanking Trent for his service. It was signed by many in our ward today… . Randy Rose, Sam Ng, Carl Moberly, Tex Prows, Oddie Kelly, Dave Lang, Nathan Mahelona, Brian Hogstrom, David Nelson, Josiah Drew. . . Sacrifice for each other . For any service there is a feeling thankfulness by another. I want to share some of my thank you observation I see in words, deeds, or actions from other Ward members. . Oddie Kelly. There are many memories of gospel being shared in oue classrooms. Oddie is someone I have counted on for participation. Oddie and his comments always begin, “I am so gratfule to be among you …”. . | Brian Akagi. I have always been amazed at the behind the scenes service I have seen from Brian in the media room, he has assisted in bringing the broadcast to those of us in need. Brian’s behind the scenes efforts don’t end there… . | Heidi Drew. The years of Music responsibility. The music of Christmas and other holidays has been filled with music provided by Heidi for many years. Her efforts stand out as a memory for me, particularly when I participate in choir. . | Gavin Raichart. The years of Testimony meeting responsibility. There have been many “man’ size and heart felt testimonies from this “getting” older young person. . | Taelure Nelson. I don’t believe there has ever been and munch-and-mingle activity where I have not seen Taelure doing something productive and important behind the scenes. Taelure is always doing something to serve us .. . | Terry Finch, Eddie Strause, Mark Edmonson. The building the scenes of Halloween and Christmas. There is a feeling of yesteryear and service reminisence in all the provide in props. . | Nathan and Devi Mahalona. The great example of going and serving the Lord as missionaries. They represent who I want to become .. . | . Ward Caring . By definition, sacrifice is simply caring and turning our will toward God. The spirt most certainly bolsters any such event. . Sister Sigle. A couple of weeks ago, “our sacrifice” became somewhat “complete” with regards to our long time ward member Claudia Sigle. Our ward overwhelmed it on this Monday afternoon. . Hector, Gary, Jared, Mark, Warren, Taelure, Claudia Hernandez, Lora and Tiernan, Gina, Heidi, Brian Wetzger, Lori Moberly, Cregg &amp; Gabe Taylor, Brian &amp; Karen Akagi, Randy &amp; Cindy. . I arrived on the scene and surely Taelure Nelson was there with Claudia Hernandez and of course Sister Hernandez smiling, greeting, smiling and saying, “your late”. There is always a humbling that comes with service. But the event was full of joy. . . Church bolsters us “Light the World” . Our faith and desire to server is bolstered by community. The Church and stake Mikkel ans Schafer send a lot of messages to help us remember Joy and to share Light. . #1 Give your favorite book to someone. I see a bond between my wife and her mother by sharing simple things. | . … . #50 Laugh with a friend. On our Sigle move, it seemed that there was a lot of laughter. Simplly watching people work together, sometimes awkwardly, brings a lot of joy. | . Light the world begins with a smile. Then the light of us all Jesus Christ seems to come through our simple actions. . Seeking service . Looking to the Church helps. Transitions in life are a series of starts, continuations, and some ends. . Serving God is love, love never ends. . Sometimes our balance changes. The percentages of showing God’s love change(+-), the key is finding good balances. Trying to find God through faith in all phases of Church and Adult life. . Seminary and High School (bolster your day) | A truck driver 1 year (preparing to serve) 🥲 | A missionary; 2 years (90% serving God) 👍 | A college student; 4 years (10% serving God) | A tech guy; 36 years (10% serving God) 😅 | A husband; Tamara: 19 years, Lora: 17 years (focus on development and joy, 50% serving God) 👍 | A father; Trent, Corey, Claire, Tiernan, Shay, 36 years 👏 | A grandfather; Amelia, Cruz, and Gavi; 9 years 😇 | A teacher, working on my 5th year (focus on education, 50% serving God) 🫶 | . Forced acts of service . Sometimes burdens of life bring “forced” acts of service. Watching Lori Moberly with Carl reminded me back to my time with Tamara. In such a situation, you know the end is coming, you just don’t know when. As a 3rd party, to Lori and Carl it is hard to know what to do. . In my case with Tamara, the Tender mercies of Heaven accompanied my every step. Small events of failure and realization become lasting memories. . After Tamara died, memories, geneology, and temple work interweave. . Similar to Joseph and his experiences with Alvin. I had experiences of a parted veil in my dreams. . Service comes with Risks . Justin Diczhazy was my friend. I felt responsible to his Dad and Justin in all things. Justin went to meetings, get aways, or to clinics whenever I asked. . My Brother Jase came to me in sickness. He was my look up to figure from my youth. . Don’t think that service will always have a happy ending. . Justin died of overdose. . My brothers died from AIDS. . We may never know God’s plan. But I witness that God has touched me in all my Service events. . Faith inspired acts of service . I believe God opens doors and miracles to those who seek them. In my case, I looked an after coorporate life mircale… . Served as a badged missionary and Wildwood Ranch | Served as a one day a week Temple Worker | Served in logistic operations worker at the Red Cross | Served as a Math Teaching assistant at San Diego High School | . I have beeen fortuante to have found an opportunity where I see my son Shay on a daily basis. Many things folded together to help me make Teaching a service choice. . Model Trains and Service . Best intentions sometimes mess up. I was trying to “serve”, but it did not work out the way I expected. Sorry Roy, Tiernan, Shay and others. Service should not be by my parameters. . I tried to give gas money to my daughter during Thanksgiving. Sorry Claire, I will try to keep sickness to my own time. . Overall, God is love, family is love. Ward family is love. The service is were we can tend to make things more difficult. .",

            "content": ". Come Follow Me Lessons . This Week . Last Week . Hebrews and its Author . IMO, the KJV is a literary masterpiece. Many passages I have undertaken to memorize simply because of there sound. I glory in God for how it has been preserved. We are so lucky to be readers and studiers of the news that Jesus is the Christ. . The authorship of the Book of Hebrews in the New Testament is a subject of debate and remains uncertain. However, the King James bible says… “THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE HEBREWS”. . According to James Goldberg the entirety of the title page may be a lie BYUTV Come Follow Up. Perhaps you can speculate what that lie might be? . Theory of Alternate Writers . James Goldberg and ChatGPT specify there could be many authors… including Paul, Barnabas, Apollos, Priscilla, or an unknown early Christian figure. However, no conclusive evidence exists to definitively identify the author. . Priscilla being involved with her husband Aquila is a romantic notion of personal interst. It also lines up with some scholars ideas that languages is different between “we” of Hebrews versus “I” in most epistles. . Hebrews 2:3-4 “How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.” | . versus . Philemon 1:8-9: “Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you.” | . Theory of bad Greek verus good Greek . James Goldberg states that the Greek of Pauline epistles is not good. But, the Greek in Hebrews is amazing. This hints, that if Paul were the writer, someone else must have been his scribe. This idea, resonates with me as I have found the Pauline epistles hard to read, but Hebrews has always been more enjoyable for me. . IMO, the stylistic differences between the Pauline letters and Hebrews is still apparent in the translation from Greek to English in KJV. . Hebrews 2:5-8: “For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.” | . versus . Romans 5:6-8: “For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” | . Theory of I versus We Style . In Hebrews, there is no direct address to a particular individual or community at the beginning of the letter. Instead, the author starts with a more general statement and sets the tone for a broader, more sermon-like message about the superiority of Christ. . Hebrews 1:1-2: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;” | . versus . Pauline Epistle (Philippians 1:1): “Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.” | . Theory that Paul is dead before Hebrews . Scholars argue that the themes and concerns addressed in Hebrews, such as the role of the Old Covenant and the superiority of Christ, are different from those typically found in Paul’s writings. This has led to speculation that the letter reflects developments in Christian theology that may have occurred after Paul’s time. . Hebrews contains elements of hope in Jesus, it is primarily a theological and exhortative work, focusing on the superiority of Jesus and the New Covenant over the Old Covenant. One of the key passages that highlights Jesus as the High Priest in the Book of Hebrews is found in Hebrews 4:12-16 (KJV): . 12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. . | 13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. . | 14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. . | 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. . | 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. . | . This passage emphasizes that Jesus is the “great high priest” who has a unique ability to sympathize with human weaknesses because He was also tempted in every way, yet He remained without sin. As the High Priest, He is a source of mercy and grace for believers, and they are encouraged to approach Him with confidence. . Hebrews using the Book of Mormon . In discussion with Lora, we talked about Hebrews beigh better but really enjoyed complimenting it with the Book of Mormon with regards to … “Jesus Christ suffered all things so that He can understand and help me when I suffer”. . As we have read “that we may obtain mercy” in Hebrews 4:16, what does that look like for you? . The atonement of Jesus in Hebrews 2:9-18 state grace, salvation through suffering, sanctification, abrahamic covenant, merciful High Priest, succor. . 9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man . . | 10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. . | 11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, . | 12-14 … . | 15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. . | 16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. . | 17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. . | 18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. . | . compare to Alma 7:11-13 . 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. . | 12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. . | 13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me. . | . compare to Alma 34 . 8 And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it. . | 14 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. . | 15 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance. . | 16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption. . | 17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you; . | 18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save. . | 19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him . | 28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith. . | 29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men. . | 32 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. . | 36 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb. . | 41 But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions. . | . Personalize the Succor of Jesus . Faith is a central theme in the Book of Hebrews, and the author discusses its significance throughout these chapters. Here’s a notable passage that speaks to the importance of faith: . Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. . Steve Jobs Last Words . https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-steve-jobs-final-words-weal/fact-check-final-words-of-steve-jobs-were-not-about-wealth-idUSKCN26C266 https://equalman.com/steve-jobs-last-words/ . At the age of 56, Steve Jobs died a billionaire. Close family members say that his dying words were “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.” Whether he penned an essay during the days leading up to his death is probably unlikely, but it is still being debated. What we do know is that Jobs often sacrificed his family to achieve success in business. At one point he went so far as to deny that he was the legitimate father of his daughter, Lisa, surprising on many levels, especially given that Jobs was adopted as a child. . Steve Jobs’ Legacy The following is thought to be the essay Jobs wrote in his last days. While its authenticity might be disputed, its profundity cannot be. . I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death. . You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you, but you cannot have someone bear your sickness for you. Material things lost can be found or replaced. But there is one thing that can never be found when it’s lost—Life. Whichever stage in life you’re in right now, with time, you will face the day when the curtain falls. . Treasure love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends. Treat yourself well and cherish others. As we grow older, and hopefully wiser, we realize that a $3000 or a $30 watch both tell the same time. You will realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first class or economy, if the plane goes down—you go down with it. . Therefore, I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, sing with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, that is true happiness. . Don’t educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be happy. So when they grow up they will know the value of things and not the price. . Eat your food as your medicine, otherwise, you have to eat medicine as your food. . The One who loves you will never leave you for another because, even if there are 100 reasons to give up, he or she will find a reason to hold on. . There is a big difference between a human being and being human. Only a few really understand it. . You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, you have to manage. . The six best doctors in the world are sunlight, rest, exercise, diet, self-confidence, and friends. Maintain them in all stages and enjoy a healthy life.” . The Broken Dish . In Come Follow Up, James Goldberg illustrates “A new dish, a broken dish, and a restored dish”. The broken dish will be a part of our life. There will be times where things go wrong. In my life, faith and turning to the succor of Jesus is where I have found hope. . How did you find comfort in Jesus from Hebrews, Timothy, Titus, Philemon and Book of Mormon scriptures? . In the analogy of a broken dish, plus Amulek suggesting visit sick, afflicted, naked, hungry; how do we help someone that is suffering in the state of being broken? . How do you go through the process of being broken, moving past it, to restoration? How have influences of others assisted? . Be Prepared . Hebrews 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. | . In previous weeks lessons we had Great Direction in 1 Timothy 6 on preparation… . 17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; . | 18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; . | 19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. . | . Restorative actions like “Thinking Celestial” . Mortality is a master class in learning to choose the things of greatest eternal importance. . “I invite you to adopt the practice of ‘thinking celestial.’ Thinking celestial means being spiritually minded.” . Thinking celestial will change one’s heart and lead to praying more sincerely. . Applying the succor of Jesus . Alma 7:11-12 “And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.” . Hebrews 1-6, and the entire Book of Hebrews, underscores the role of faith in the lives of believers. The author encourages readers to have faith in Jesus as the ultimate High Priest and Savior and to persevere in their faith in the face of trials and difficulties. Faith is portrayed as a key element in the journey of personal restoration and spiritual growth. . 1 Timothy and Titus: These pastoral letters, contain guidance on living a godly life, showing integrity, and being examples to others.

Look for passages that emphasize godliness, sound teaching, and setting a positive example for others. .

Scripture Study: Regularly study the scriptures, including the Bible and Book of Mormon, to find inspiration and guidance for your personal restoration. The scriptures can provide valuable insights and principles to apply in your life. . Service and Kind Deeds: Engage in acts of service and kindness toward others.

I am thinking both in and outside of Sunday School class. . Today I hope we will all give our best effort to bond and build our community, as followers of Jesus Christ. . Community/Bond. A week ago, My wife and I went to a Duran Duran concert. We saw Peter Bybee and Tex, Julie Prows. This week my wife saw Tauna Lang at Costco. In both these scenarios, we had a “bond, connection, or community feeling”, to those we saw and conversed; even though we don’t often talk to these people at church. But we do share through much through lessons, testimonies, socials, and service. Consider the mathematical probability of meeting fellow Ward members. Does the Lord bolster us, by having these connections? Or, are they just by random chance? . Separated by Accomplishment . About 40 million Americans have left “the church” in the last 25 years.

Every part of the body is Essential . We should recognize every part of the body. We should not compare or elevate one portion of the body above others. There is a righteous for of covet, where we earnestly strive to magnify the gifts we are given. . 1 Corinthians 12:25-31 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? . 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? . 17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?

There were several trucks, driving skill, strength, love, many other gifts, all freely provided, and all for the common good. IMO, the gifts and the diversity of gifts were essential to the success. . 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; . 9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; . 10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues . Charity (aka Love) never Fails . “Charity” is often understood as a synonym for love, particularly the kind of selfless and unconditional love that transcends mere emotions. . In summary, charity, as described in 1 Corinthians 13, encompasses qualities such as love, kindness, patience, generosity, humility, forgiveness, unselfishness, optimism, endurance, and consistency. It’s a profound and selfless way of relating to others that goes beyond mere words or actions, reflecting a deep and enduring love for humanity. . Charity and 1 Corinthians 13 . 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. . 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. . 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. . 4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, . 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; . 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; . 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. . 8 Charity never faileth. . Qualities of Charity . Here are some other words and phrases that can help describe and expand upon the concept of charity as presented in Corithians: . Love: As mentioned earlier, charity is often equated with love, which is a selfless and sacrificial love that seeks the well-being of others without expecting anything in return. . Kindness: Charity involves being kind and compassionate toward others, showing goodwill and empathy in your actions. . Patience: “Charity suffereth long” suggests that charity is patient and doesn’t easily lose its temper or become frustrated. . Generosity: Charity often involves giving to others, whether it’s your time, resources, or support. It’s a spirit of generosity and sharing. . Humility: “Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up” indicates that charity is humble and doesn’t boast or seek to elevate itself above others. . Forgiveness: “Charity… thinketh no evil” implies a willingness to forgive and not hold grudges. . Unselfishness: “Seeketh not her own” emphasizes that charity is not focused on personal gain or self-interest but rather on the welfare of others. . Optimism: “Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth” suggests that charity is optimistic and values truth and righteousness. . Endurance: “Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things” underscores the enduring nature of charity, its ability to persevere through challenges, and its faith in the goodness of others. . Consistency: “Charity never faileth” emphasizes that true charity is unwavering and doesn’t diminish over time or circumstances. . Agape Love and Charity . Agape love is a term often used in Christian theology and philosophy to describe a particular kind of selfless, unconditional, and divine love. It’s one of several Greek words for love found in the New Testament, and each word conveys a slightly different nuance of love. Here’s a brief explanation of the different types of love in Greek: . Eros: Eros refers to romantic or passionate love, often associated with desire and attraction between two people. . Philia: Philia represents brotherly or friendship love, characterized by camaraderie, loyalty, and affection between friends. . Storge: Storge denotes natural affection, such as the love between family members, particularly parents and children. . Agape: Agape is the highest form of love in Greek philosophy and Christian theology. It’s often described as a selfless, unconditional, and sacrificial love that seeks the well-being and happiness of others without expecting anything in return. Agape love is considered divine and is central to Christian teachings, emphasizing love for God and love for one’s neighbor as oneself. . In the context of 1 Corinthians 13, when it mentions “charity,” it is essentially describing agape love. This passage is emphasizing the importance of this selfless and sacrificial love as the highest virtue, suggesting that even extraordinary gifts and abilities are meaningless without it. Agape love is often seen as the ultimate expression of Christian love and is a guiding principle for how Christians should relate to one another and to the world. . Other Scriptures on Charity . These scriptures from Christian and LDS traditions emphasize the central role of love, charity, and selflessness in the teachings and principles of faith. They underscore the importance of love for God, love for one’s neighbor, and the transformative power of charity in the lives of believers. . Matthew 22:37-40: In this passage, Jesus summarizes the greatest commandments, highlighting the importance of love: “Jesus replied: ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” . John 13:34-35: Jesus teaches his disciples about the new commandment of love: “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.” . 1 John 4:7-8: The Apostle John emphasizes the centrality of love in the Christian faith: “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” . Doctrine and Covenants 88:125 (LDS Standard Works): This scripture from the Doctrine and Covenants emphasizes the importance of love in the context of seeking learning and wisdom: “And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.” . Moroni 7:45 (Book of Mormon): In this passage, the Book of Mormon teaches about the attributes of charity: “And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” . People can reject Charity . The Savior loved all. But, sometimes love is not accepted. . 1 Nephi 11:22 (Book of Mormon): This scripture passage highlights the importance of love in the context of the Savior’s ministry: “And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them&lt; mark&gt;.&quot; . Christ, who embodies perfect charity and love, ministered to the people, not all accepted His message. This reflects a recurring theme in religious narratives where divine love and truth are sometimes rejected by those who hold firmly to their existing traditions and beliefs. . In the case of this specific passage, it’s a reflection of the challenges and resistance that prophets and messengers often face when they bring a message of change or spiritual renewal. It underscores the idea that true charity and love, as exemplified by Christ, may not always be readily embraced, especially when it challenges the status quo or existing religious practices. . It’s a reminder that love and charity can be transformative, but individuals and communities may need time to open their hearts and minds to new revelations and spiritual truths. The rejection of Christ&#39;s message by some serves as a poignant illustration of the complexity of human responses to divine love and teachings. . Summary of Paul’s teaching to Corinth . The writings of Paul in the Corinthians epistles provide a valuable and insightful progression of ideas, emphasizing the unity and interdependence of the Christian community. There is a logical flow in his teachings, starting with the idea that believers are one body through Communion, then highlighting the diversity of spiritual gifts, and ultimately stressing the importance of love (charity) in holding this diverse body together. Here is a break down this progression: . One Body through Communion: In 1 Corinthians 10:16-17, Paul uses the imagery of Communion to convey the idea that believers are one body because they partake in the same symbolic elements, the bread representing the body of Christ and the cup representing His blood. This emphasizes their shared identity and unity as members of the body of Christ. . Diversity of Spiritual Gifts: Paul goes on to discuss the diversity of spiritual gifts and roles within the Christian community in 1 Corinthians 12. He illustrates that just as the human body has different parts with unique functions, so does the body of believers. Each member has a specific role and spiritual gift to contribute to the well-being of the whole. . Importance of Love (Charity): After discussing the diversity of gifts and roles, Paul transitions to 1 Corinthians 13, often referred to as the “Love Chapter.” Here, he emphasizes that no matter how diverse the gifts and roles may be, they must be exercised with love (charity). Love is the binding force that holds the diverse body of believers together. Without love, all other gifts and actions are empty and meaningless. . This progression of ideas in Paul’s writings serves to teach the Corinthians (and all readers) about the essential qualities of a strong and harmonious Christian community. It reminds them that unity and diversity can coexist when guided by love and charity, and that love is the greatest of all virtues. This message is not only relevant to the Corinthians but continues to be a guiding principle for Christian and All communities and individuals seeking to live out their faith in a spirit of love and unity. .",

Associate the Quote . My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness . Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy . However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise. So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?

My questions … Who has claimed to be the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof? Rome, United States? Any other speculation or opinions in references out there? | . | . ChatGPT Response . In the parable you described from Matthew 21:33-46, the householder represents God, the vineyard represents the kingdom of God, and the husbandmen represent the religious leaders or the people of Israel. The servants sent by the householder represent the prophets sent by God throughout history to the people of Israel, and the son represents Jesus Christ. The phrase in Matthew 21:43, &quot;The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,&quot; suggests a transfer of the blessings and responsibilities of the kingdom of God from the people of Israel (represented by the husbandmen) to another nation. This statement does not specifically mention any particular nation by name. Interpretations of this parable may vary among theologians and scholars. Some speculate that the nation mentioned could refer to the early Christian Church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers. Others may interpret it more symbolically, suggesting that it represents the establishment and spread of Christianity throughout the world beyond the borders of Israel. It is important to note that while the parable itself does not explicitly identify the nation to which the kingdom of God is given, it serves as a warning to the religious leaders of the time and emphasizes the rejection of Jesus, the Son of God, by the religious authorities. Ultimately, the interpretation of this parable and the identification of the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof can vary among individuals and scholars, and it is advisable to consult various theological perspectives and teachings for a comprehensive understanding. Can you find &quot;theological perspectives&quot; on this from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints? Certainly! The interpretation of the parable you mentioned, as viewed through the lens of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, can be found in the teachings of LDS Church leaders and scripture. Here are a few references that provide insights from a Latter-day Saint perspective: &quot;The House of Israel&quot; and &quot;the Gentiles&quot;: In LDS theology, the house of Israel represents the covenant people of God, which includes both the ancient Israelites and their descendants. The Gentiles refer to those who are not of the house of Israel. Latter-day Saint teachings often emphasize that the gathering of Israel and the spreading of the gospel are ongoing processes. The parable can be understood as a message that the blessings of the kingdom of God, including the gospel and priesthood authority, would be shared with people of all nations, both Israelite and Gentile. Book of Mormon: The Book of Mormon, considered scripture by Latter-day Saints, contains additional teachings and interpretations of the parable. For example, 3 Nephi 16:10 states that if the Gentiles reject the fullness of the gospel, it will be taken from them and given to the remnants of the house of Israel. This concept aligns with the parable&#39;s message of the transfer of blessings and responsibilities. Teachings of Church Leaders: Various talks and writings by LDS Church leaders offer insights into this parable. For instance, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a former Apostle of the LDS Church, addressed the parable in his book &quot;The Mortal Messiah.&quot; He discussed how the rejection of Jesus and His gospel by the religious leaders led to the inclusion of the Gentiles in receiving the blessings of the kingdom. It is important to note that individual interpretations and perspectives within the LDS Church may vary, and the official teachings of the Church are primarily found in its scriptures and statements from current Church leaders. Therefore, studying these sources can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the specific theological perspectives on this parable within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The transition from discussing commandments to discussing seemingly unrelated hobbies and interests could be a lighthearted way of exploring the idea of what it means to love God in the context of various aspects of life, including personal hobbies and entertainment preferences. In essence, the conversation may have taken a humorous detour to highlight the idea that even in our interests and hobbies, we can find ways to express love for God and see connections to our faith. Humor can often serve as a way to bring joy, creativity, and unexpected perspectives into discussions. 2nd bit of Help to ChatGPT. Close to the family event. What if I provide you the hint to have &quot;no other Gods&quot; in relation to the humor? If the hint is to have &quot;no other Gods&quot; in relation to the humor and the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV shows, it could be inferred that the humorous connection is centered around the idea of having a strong or intense interest in these topics. The humor might stem from playfully exaggerating or jokingly suggesting that these hobbies or interests have become so important or captivating that they could be seen as competing with or taking the place of a person&#39;s devotion to God. In other words, the humorous implication could be that these topics or activities have become &quot;gods&quot; in a figurative sense, capturing a significant amount of attention or devotion. This kind of humor often arises when people find amusing ways to juxtapose mundane or unrelated topics with significant or sacred concepts, highlighting the contrast between the two. It allows for a lighthearted exploration of the balance between our passions and our spiritual priorities, reminding us not to let our interests overshadow our love and devotion to God.

Thank you! I&#39;m glad I was able to accurately infer the humor in your family dialog.

In reading the story in the New Testament of the Rich Young Man, told three times Matthew 19:16–22; Mark 10:17–22; Luke 18:18–23. Can you see how this relates to Model Trains, Computer Science, and Korean TV from our family story. | . ChatGPT Response . The story you mentioned from the New Testament, often referred to as the story of the &quot;Rich Young Ruler,&quot; can be found in Matthew 19:16–22, Mark 10:17–22, and Luke 18:18–23. This story involves a rich young man who approaches Jesus and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments, and the young man claims to have kept them since his youth. Jesus then instructs him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him, but the young man walks away saddened because he had great wealth. In relating this story to the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV from your family story, we can draw some connections: Model Trains: Just as the rich young man had possessions, including great wealth, model trains could be seen as a hobby or interest that involves material possessions. The story reminds us not to let our attachment to material things hinder our commitment to following Jesus. Computer Science: Similarly, computer science or any other profession or area of expertise can be seen as something we dedicate our time and energy to. The story reminds us that our commitment to following Jesus should take precedence over any worldly pursuits or attachments, including our professional endeavors. Korean TV: While Korean TV shows may not involve material possessions like model trains or a profession like computer science, the story highlights the importance of prioritizing our relationship with God over any personal interests or pleasures. It serves as a reminder that nothing should hinder our commitment to following Jesus, even if it means letting go of things that bring us enjoyment or entertainment. In summary, the story of the Rich Young Ruler prompts us to examine our priorities and reminds us to put our devotion to God above worldly attachments, whether they are material possessions, personal interests, or professional pursuits. 2nd question to ChatGPT.

In the Mark account of the story of the Rich Young Ruler, there is a notable emphasis on Jesus&#39; response and his display of compassion and love towards the young man. After the young man expresses his desire to inherit eternal life and claims to have kept the commandments, Mark 10:21 states: &quot;Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, &#39;You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&#39;&quot; The inclusion of the phrase &quot;Jesus, looking at him, loved him&quot; highlights the compassion and care that Jesus felt towards the young man. This statement suggests that Jesus genuinely desired the young man to experience the blessings of eternal life and was willing to provide him with specific guidance and instructions to help him on that path. While love and compassion are also present in the other Gospel accounts of this story (Matthew 19:16–22 and Luke 18:18–23), the Mark account explicitly mentions Jesus&#39; love for the young man, providing a unique emphasis on the compassionate nature of Jesus&#39; response. This emphasis on Jesus&#39; love and compassion in the Mark account could resonate with individuals who value and appreciate the deep care and understanding that Jesus demonstrated towards those seeking guidance and eternal life.

May I plead with us not to be hurt—and certainly not to feel envious—when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon. This parable—like all parables—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace.

The Sabbath, Church, and the Sacrament. | DC 78:17-19 Do you ever remember a time you may have been rushed and forgot to thank someone? | Alma 34:38 Is there anything that you do to remain grateful? | Remember from Isaiah and President Nelson … “call the sabbath a delight”. What makes the Sabbath a day to Rejoice? How does the Sabbath help us to become the one that returns and gives gratitude to the Lord? | . Can we Rejoice in the story of “the Woman caught in Adultry”? . John 8:1-11 It seems to have profoundly impacted John as he wrote “And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.”, referring to Jesus. As I read this story, writting on the ground impacted on me. It helped me greatly with my own story, where I felt caught in the middle of two loved ones. . This story is about allowing only “family” to an upcoming “family reunion”. This rule, I believe, is based off of our Patriarch for the reunion (pictured) likely using “The Family Proclamation” as his guide. My daughter (also picture), who has a girlfriend, wants to bring her to the reunion. Regarding rule… “Claire I went to bat for you regarding reunion and failed. They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus” | My attempt at a Peacemaker statement… “Lora and I will pray for a change of heart” | Support of Reunion and purpose… “In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents.” | Clair’s Response… “I understand. I was thinking…. Is there anyway you guys would be willing to pick me up on the way?” | Summary… I was energized by this parable to take the proverbial time to “draw in the ground”. The reading of the parable and the family discussion were synchronous in timing in my life. In this event, I was so proud of Claire’s response. It seemed Claire answered my prayers, while in my thought process I was focussed on my Father-in-Law from my deceased wife. Though, we all know our family stories continue… My prayers need to continue… Stay tuned for the post family reunion update. | . | . . Have you Rejoiced in “Finding the One?”? . Luke 15:3-10.

On the Peter Nicholls story, I had two opportunities to find him in England 30+ years after we lost contact. We attended Kings Lynn Ward as I brought a non-member from work.

About 4 years ago I found an old picture of him, I sent him a picture with caption “I found you Peter!”.

My brother, 6 years my Senior, was closest thing I had to a Dad. My brother and I were exposed to a lot. James (Jase), my brother, was a Gay man. There were multiple returns of Jase into my life, a signifcant one was were he ended up staying with my mother and step dad Giovanni, until my Mother passed.. At the end of his life, Jase was stranded in Central Valley as he and his cat, on his own permission, were driving to live out his final days with me. He often told others the the Mormons saved him in the desert. Less than a year later, Jase died of AIDS. | I was often jealous of my brother many times in life. In his last year in San Diego, I was jealous about how he freely and boldly spoke about Jesus and how he glorified his purpose and mission. | Of course, with this jealousy, came our critical perspectives of him as he would do things like leave “Marijuana Joints” in our backyard. | To take a line from President Nelson. In this story, were you thinking that my brother was the prodigal son? | I loved Jase and was proud to have him as my brother. In the theory of doctrine, we might call him prodigal. In theory of love and being loved, my brother was far superior. | To lead into the Father Abraham parable, I see Jase in his bosom.

Were you able to turn it into Gratitude or Rejoicing? . The Good Shepherd John 10:1-30 . He goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. This seems to be a straightforward parable. Any deeper interpretaions? . ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Good Shepherd is a powerful and deeply symbolic image of Christ as our loving and protective shepherd who leads us to safety and salvation. While the parable can be understood on a literal level as a story about sheep and a shepherd, it also has several deeper meanings and interpretations. . One interpretation of the parable is that the sheep represent humanity and the shepherd represents Christ. The sheep who recognize and follow the shepherd’s voice represent those who have accepted Christ as their Savior and have a personal relationship with Him. The sheep who do not recognize the shepherd’s voice represent those who have not yet accepted Christ or who have strayed from the path of righteousness. . Another interpretation of the parable is that the shepherd represents the leadership of the Church, and the sheep represent the members of the Church. The parable emphasizes the importance of following the guidance and direction of Church leaders, who are called to be shepherds and watch over the spiritual well-being of the members. . The parable also emphasizes the love and care that the shepherd has for his sheep. Christ’s willingness to lay down his life for his sheep represents his ultimate sacrifice on the cross for the salvation of humanity.

Now my proverbial “treasures” are intended to take care of me, my wife and family for years to come. Anyone have interesting interpretations on retirement savings? . ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Foolish Rich Man is a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and materialism. The rich man in the story was so focused on accumulating wealth and enjoying his own pleasures that he neglected to consider the needs of others, and he ultimately lost everything. . In terms of modern interpretation regarding retirement, the parable can be seen as a warning against being overly focused on accumulating wealth and material possessions, and instead encourages a focus on investing in things that truly matter, such as relationships, experiences, and spiritual growth. . While saving for retirement is important, the parable suggests that our ultimate treasures should be things that are not subject to the uncertainties of life, such as a strong relationship with God and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This may mean investing time and resources into charitable causes or community involvement, rather than simply accumulating wealth for ourselves. . In addition, the parable emphasizes the importance of being prepared for unexpected events or emergencies, as the rich man was not prepared for his sudden death and lost everything. This can be interpreted as a call to be prudent in financial planning, and to have contingency plans in place for unexpected events. . Overall, the Parable of the Foolish Rich Man reminds us to keep our priorities in order, and to focus on investing in things that truly matter and bring lasting fulfillment, rather than being consumed by the pursuit of wealth and material possessions. . The great supper Luke 14:12–24 . No one is showing up to the supper, they all have an excuses. Since I serve as a Missionary, sometimes I had this thought. The key to story is probably that we attend the supper. Any other thoughts? . ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14:12-24) tells the story of a man who throws a great banquet and invites many guests. However, when the time comes for the banquet, all of the guests make excuses and decline the invitation. The host becomes angry and sends his servant out into the streets to invite anyone and everyone to the banquet, regardless of their social standing. The servant returns with a diverse group of guests, and the banquet is a success. . The key message of the parable is that the invitation to the banquet represents the invitation to salvation and eternal life with God, and that many people will make excuses and refuse the invitation. The parable highlights the importance of accepting the invitation and responding to God’s call, and warns of the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ. . As a missionary, you may have encountered people who make excuses or refuse to consider the message of the gospel. The parable is a reminder that not everyone will respond positively to the invitation, and that rejection and indifference are common responses. However, the parable also offers hope in the form of the second group of guests who accept the invitation and enjoy the banquet. This group represents those who respond to the gospel message with faith and obedience, and who will ultimately be rewarded with eternal life. . Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of accepting God’s invitation to salvation and living a life of faith and obedience. It also highlights the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ. As a missionary, you can share this message with others and invite them to accept the invitation to the great banquet of eternal life with God. . The unjust steward Luke 16:1–12 . A lesson in stewardship, “faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much”. . ChatGPT assistance… Yes, the Parable of the Unjust Steward (Luke 16:1-12) is a well-known story told by Jesus. It’s a challenging parable that has been interpreted in a number of ways by scholars and theologians over the years. . In the parable, a rich man discovers that his steward (manager) has been squandering his possessions. The rich man calls the steward to account and tells him that he will be fired. The steward then goes to his master’s debtors and reduces the amount they owe in order to make friends for himself, perhaps hoping that these debtors will help him out when he loses his job. . Jesus concludes the parable by saying that the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted shrewdly. Jesus then goes on to say, “For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations” (Luke 16:8-9, KJV). . Many scholars interpret this parable as a lesson in shrewdness or wise use of resources. Jesus is not commending the steward for his dishonesty but rather for his shrewdness in using his remaining time and resources to prepare for the future. Jesus is urging his followers to use their resources wisely in order to prepare for their eternal destiny. . Other scholars interpret the parable as a lesson in stewardship, as you mentioned. Jesus is teaching that those who are faithful in small matters will also be faithful in larger ones. The steward was unfaithful in his management of his master’s possessions, but he was shrewd in using his remaining time to make amends. Jesus is urging his followers to be faithful and responsible in all areas of life, including the use of their resources and possessions. . Overall, the Parable of the Unjust Steward is a challenging story that requires careful interpretation. However, one clear message that emerges is the importance of wise use of resources and faithful stewardship in all areas of life. . The rich man and Lazarus Luke 16:19–31 . Lazarus (a beggar) and the rich man die, there is a dialog with Father Abraham and Lazarus. Interestingly, the rich man attempts to work up a plan to save his family. Does this make us think there is hope for rich man? Was Jesus hinting at this? . ChatGPT assistance… In the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), the rich man and Lazarus die, and their fates in the afterlife are drastically different. Lazarus is carried by the angels to Abraham’s side, while the rich man is tormented in Hades. In the dialogue between the rich man and Abraham, the rich man pleads for mercy and relief from his torment, and he also asks Abraham to send Lazarus to his father’s house to warn his five brothers so they will not end up in the same place of torment. . The fact that the rich man is concerned for his family members and their fate suggests that he is not entirely without compassion or concern for others. However, the parable does not offer any explicit indication of the rich man’s spiritual state or his ultimate fate. It’s possible that Jesus included this detail to emphasize the importance of warning others about the reality of judgment and eternal consequences. The rich man’s concern for his brothers may be seen as a reminder that we should also be concerned about the spiritual welfare of those around us. . Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and caring for those who are in need. While it’s possible to interpret the rich man’s concern for his family as a sign of hope for his salvation, the parable does not provide a clear answer on the matter. Ultimately, the parable serves as a warning about the reality of judgment and the importance of living a life that reflects our faith and commitment to God. .",

With His dying breath, Jesus addressed His Father. “It is finished,” He said (John 19:30). An unlikely testimony came from a Roman centurion and those who were with him: “Truly this was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). The realization is just as awe-inspiring today as it was then. .

It was common to extend hospitality to travelers and guests. It was also common for people to eat together in groups. Meals were often shared on low tables, with guest reclining on cushions or mats. Reading from My Jewish Learning and from personal experience I believe that this custom continues in certain cultures … There is reference in this to Abraham, Sarah, and three travelers that informed Sarah that she would have a child. Opening home and sitting down to a meals is an amazing opportunity to learn. . Nov 11, 2007 email from John to Lora… BYU (campus) was closed, church was on Saturday.

And he arose and followed him. . 15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. . 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? . 17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. . | Luke 5:27-32 All accounts mention the Publican and Follow me . 27 ¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. . 28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him. . 29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. . 30 But their scribes and *Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? . 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. . 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. . | . Pharisees, They sat down to meat . Eating with Pharisees was breaking with social norms at the time. Because of customs and the open nature of breaking bread … A woman knew that Jesus was at the Pharisse’s house and brought an alabaster box. She performed the act of washing Jesus’s feet, which is considered a sign humility and service. This act was a powerfuls symbol of devotion and love … Jesus used this event to teach, which could be seen as a challenge to the Pharisee’s authourity. Notice how he talks to Simon, this is Simon the Pharisee, not the apostle. . . Luke 7:36-50 . 36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. . 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, . 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. . 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. . 40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. . 41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. . 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.

And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. . 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. . 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. . 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. . 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. . 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. . 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? . 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. . Commentary. Thy faith hath saved thee is the theme for the week in Come Follow Me. This story of the Woman emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus as a means of salvation. It also highlights the power of repentance, humility, and love towards God as the way to receive God’s forgiveness and mercy. Overall, this story shows that no matter how great one’s sins may be, God’s love and forgiveness are available to all. . Palsy Miracles, I have not found so great faith . At the time of Jesus, “palsy” was a broad term used to describe a range of conditions that caused muscle weakness, such as stroke, cerebral palsy, or other neurological disorders. Today palsy could be used to describe “cerebral palsy” or “parkinsons”, things that impact muscle movement. Most of these speckic palsies have treatments today to remediate symptoms, but do not have cures. . | Matthew 8:5-13, As thou hast believed, referring to the Centerian .. not the servant who was sick with Palsy . 5 ¶ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, . 6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. . 7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. . 8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. . 9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. . 10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. . 11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. . 12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. . 13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. . Commentary and Parallels. Unrelated to Palsy specifically, but related to the dreaded disease Cancer which we don’t find in the New Testament and from my life experiences in 1984… I was engaged to be married. My financee contracted lymphoma, a cancer, she left our engaged location of Los Angeles to take treatment and be with her family in San Antonio. . It took about 6 months ‘till we both had the courage to have her return and proceed with our plans for a Temple Marriage. | We had many instances of faith by others, fasting by members of ward, and little children praying for her in her primary. | She stated that as she took out her endowments that she felt a healing come over her. | A few days prior to the Temple Endowment and Marriage the Doctor said there was no progress in the cancer, after 6+ months. | After we returned from honeymoon, two weeks from prior visit, there were no signs of cancer. | In this event, I witnessed great faith, faith by others, and a miracle | However, my belief at the time was that things were supposed to be that way. Though amazed, still | The doctors said they saw no cancer, but asked that Chemo and Radiation treatments continue just in case. | There were many hardships and loses in this period of “just in case treatments” | 20 years later, 2004 there were complications, “Mesothelioma”. Again there was fasting. | During this blessing, I reflected on something much different than our previous miracle, a moment in which I gave a blessing to a dying man | Understanding Palsy or Cancer is very difficult, even for us today. Both palsy and cancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors. | Factors of life and environment can cause storms and tempest in our lives, even death. | . | . . Mark 2:1-12, When Jesus saw their faith, the entire party . 1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. . 2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. . 3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. . 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. . 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. . 6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, . 7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? . 8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? . 9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? . 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) . 11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. . 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. . Commentary. The statement “We never saw it on this fashion” can be interpreted in a few different ways. One possibility is that the people who witnessed this miracle were amazed by the faith and persistence of the man’s friends, who went to great lengths to bring him to Jesus. It’s possible that the faith of the man’s friends were empowered by the Holy Spirit, enabling them to perform this incredible act of bringing their friend to Jesus. . They may have also been astonished by the power and authority that Jesus demonstrated in healing the man, both in forgiving his sins and physically restoring him to health. The fact that Jesus forgave the paralyzed man’s sins before physically healing him is significant, as it shows that Jesus saw the man’s spiritual condition as equally important as his physical condition. By forgiving the man’s sins, Jesus was able to fully restore him both physically and spiritually, making him “whole” in every sense of the word. . This may be why the people who witnessed this miracle were so amazed and exclaimed, “We never saw it on this fashion.” They may have been used to seeing physical healings, but the fact that Jesus was able to heal the man’s soul as well was truly extraordinary. It demonstrated Jesus’ unique power and authority as a spiritual healer and showed that he was indeed the “physician” who could make people whole again. . | . Whereas I was blind, now I see . Most of us have underlying faith in Jesus. Many of us try to live our lives according to a code of conduct in order to give and receive of his Grace. But, we don’t get peace through a single miracle. I often wonder, what did these ancient recipients do after their healings? . . John 9:25, There is a miracle in which we have followup from the person healed. The man who was blind from birth, testified and taught. The Pharises interviewed and cast him out… . 25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. . | John 9:29-34, The healed declares “him he heareth” . 29 (Pharises) We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. . 30 (Healed) The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. . 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. . 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. . 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. . 34 (Pharises) They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. . | John 9:35-38, Jesus comforts those in need . 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? . 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? . 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. . 38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. . Commentary. This story gives me a lot of peace. The blind man was lacking in knowledge and understanding. The man knew he was healed and perceived it must have been from God, but he still needed a to believe. The ability to worship him came in the second encounter with Jesus. . | . Even the Winds Obey His Will . We are very human. We can break bread, serve with God, receive miracles, and then still fall into our humanisms. All things are anticipated: a lost job, health problems, prodigal children, loss of a loved one, and then are very own declining and death. These are the storms. . . Mark 4:35-41, Right after the teaching of The sower, The mustard seed, etc, Essentially, this could be right after Church or Conference. . 35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. . 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. . 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. . 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? . 39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. . 40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? . 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? . Commentary. Peace, be Still in the hymn Master, the Tempest is Raging is related to its biblical origin, it is expanded to include the idea of Jesus bringing peace and comfort to all areas of our lives, not just literal storms at sea. . The hymn asks Jesus to speak peace to our troubled souls and to still the storms of our lives. | It expresses the faith that, just as Jesus was able to calm the winds and the waves, he is able to calm our fears and anxieties and bring us peace. | . | .",

The toughest commandment, Matthew 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. . President Nelson, Perfection Pending states, … the term perfect was translated from the Greek teleios, which means “complete.” Teleios is an adjective derived from the noun telos, which means “end.” The infinitive form of the verb is teleiono, which means “to reach a distant end, to be fully developed, to consummate, or to finish.” Please note that the word does not imply “freedom from error”; it implies “achieving a distant objective.” In fact, when writers of the Greek New Testament wished to describe perfection of behavior—precision or excellence of human effort—they did not employ a form of teleios; instead, they chose different words. … Teleios is not a total stranger to us. From it comes the prefix tele that we use every day.

As the day wore on, the people grew hungry, and Jesus’ disciples suggested that he send them away to buy food. | However, Jesus instructed his disciples to feed the people themselves, and they replied that they only had five loaves of bread and two fishes, which they had obtained from a young boy. **Jesus then took the bread and fishes, blessed them***, and began to distribute them among the crowd. Amazingly, everyone was able to eat their fill, and there were even twelve baskets of leftovers. | The story of the lad who had five loaves and two fishes is often seen as a symbol of the power of faith and the generosity of spirit.

New Testament Chronology . There is no editor of the New Testament. No one sat down an wrote it or compiled it as a single book; It is a collection. As we study … Why did it happen?

Genealogies from Old to New Testament . We all like to explore learning differently. These last few weeks, after a year of Old Testament study, and so many open questions about authors, dates, and theories of man … I have been very interested in dates correlating genealogies in the Old and New Testament according to science, geological, and sensational theorists. In pondering sensationalized knowledge, particularly in thinking about history of man and world, I think about the Temple Ceremony, I think about the restoration of the Gospel, and I believe God is right!!! That all truth and wisdom comes from Heavenly Father. . . Abraham is probably the 1st figure in the Old Testament where the generational authors may have had stories that were told to them by living persons, as many of the people lived to be 130 years old according to Exodus. . . Moses is considered the author of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers. . Well known, as we studied these Prophets … Abraham fathered Isaac (Gen. 21:1-3), | Isaac fathered Jacob (Gen. 25-21-26), | Jacob had 12 sons, including Levi (Gen. 35:23) | . | Lessor known, as we don’t think of these generations as prophets until Moses … Levi had three sons, including Kohath (Exo. 6:16). And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. | Kohath had four sons, including Amram (Exo. 6:18).

Transitioning to the New Testament, we find the genealogies of Christ from Luke and Mathew. These tell us how confusing records can be, when retold by authors after large periods of time. Worthy of note, Moses is from Levi and Christ is from Judah. . . Modern geological dating of Younger Dryas and Mat layer calculate 12,600 year ago. This seems really plausible for Adam, particularly when you study bible theorists. Though, pure biblical genealogies only takes us back 6,000 years But, none of this really matters to us spiritually. But, as we transition to biblical times, we have authors of the four Gospels recording most of their record 20 to 50 years after the events occurred. . Techniques to learn things of the Sprit . To transition to the New Testament, we need to have our Head, Body, and Spirit in a learning, seeking, finding condition. This is true for all gospel study.

This Christmas season our hope and prayer is that each of us will feel the unconditional love of the Savior and recognize the precious eternal gift of His Atoning sacrifice. . Our desire as a Stake Presidency is that every member of our congregations will feel the power and influence of communion with God, that we may all know that we are His children and that we will personally feel His love. “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God” (Romans 8:16). . We invite all to create an atmosphere and opportunity to allow the spirit to bear witness that we are His children. We encourage all members to individually or as family, before leaving home to attend Christmas Day Sacrament service, to kneel in humble prayer and plead with God that He might touch our hearts with the realization that He loves us and that our hearts may be open to hear and receive His spirit. . Like the petition in the well-known Christmas Hymn “Away in a Manger” we might prayerfully ask, - Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay - Close by me forever and love me I pray. . As you take these steps you will feel the Holy Spirit testifying of the divinity of Jesus Christ and will feel a closer connection to Him. You will give our Savior the gift that He seeks on Christmas Day – a closer relationship with Him. . We love you!

Less Conspicuous Gifts I am grateful for the matchless gift of His Son—a Son who came to earth as a baby, swaddled by a young mother and laid in a manger. A baby who would learn line upon line and grow grace for grace until He laid down His life as an offering for my sins. For your sins. For the sins of all who have ever lived and will ever live on the earth. . Transition Old Testament to New Testament . Imagine a time before knowing about a Savior. Imagine challenges in life and not being able to lean on the Atonement. In that journey people like us would likely be following a Faith and a Hope. . The Old Testament carries a spirit of eager anticipation. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with hope for renewal and deliverance by the Messiah. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (Isaiah 61:1). . | The intertestamental period (Protestant) or deuterocanonical period (Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) is the period of time between the events of the protocanonical books and the New Testament. Traditionally, it is considered to cover roughly four hundred years, spanning the ministry of Malachi (c. 420 BC) to the appearance of John the Baptist in the early 1st century AD. The biblical apocrypha is written starting 200BC, to this date, the Apocrypha are “included in the lectionaries of Anglican and Lutheran Churches”. During this period the change in common language from Biblical Hebrew to Aramaic and Hellenistic Greek. Biblical Greek or New Testament Greek, was the common supra-regional form of Greek spoken and written during the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. It evolved from the spread of Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, and served as the lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries. Reign of the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties, followed by Roman rule. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. Herod’s kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE. Because of his failure to properly rule Judea, Archelaus (son of Herod) was removed from his post by Emperor Augustus in 6 CE, while Judea, Samaria and Idumea came under direct Roman administration. . | The New Testament, a new hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see Luke 2:7). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that with His stripes you can be healed (see Isaiah 53:4–5). This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him. . | . Isaiah 53:4-5 4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. . Isaiah 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; . Luke 2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. . How do you say Merry Christmas . One thing we learn from the Old Testament to New Testament transition is that many are waiting or not sure if there was or has been a Messiah. How do you say Merry Christmas? This week I was given a present with a Tree on it and in response to the gift I said “Thank You” and “Merry Christmas”. I was called out! Christmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Even people who don’t worship Jesus as the Son of God can often feel the happiness of Christmas. I received many gifts, few from Christians. .

Isaiah 25:8–9 8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. 9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. . Isaiah 44:21–24 21 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. 22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. 24 Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; . Isaiah 51:11 Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. . Zephaniah 3:14–20; 14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 15 The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. 16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. 17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. 18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. 19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. 20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord. . Hope from our 1st Parents . Moses 5:5–11 5 And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. 6 And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me. 7 And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. 8 Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore. 9 And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will. 10 And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God. 11 And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. . “His name shall be called Wonderful.” .

Background . Book of Hosea, also spelled Osee, the first of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, considered as one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. According to the superscription, Hosea began his prophetic activity during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC). His prophetic announcements indicate that he was active until near the fall (721 BC) of the northern kingdom of Israel, the scene of his entire ministry. The text is quite corrupt and contains difficult problems of interpretation. Yahweh’s compassion for Israel, however, is generally the dominant theme. Having “played the harlot” with Canaanite rites and practices, Israel will surely experience Yahweh’s wrath, but not forever. Yahweh will welcome Israel like a husband who takes back an unfaithful wife. Britannica.com . Book of Joel, second of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets. The Jewish canon lumps all together as The Twelve and divides Joel into four chapters; Christian versions combine chapters 2 and 3. The book relates nothing about Joel except his name and that of his father. An analysis of the text further indicates that Joel lived during the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 BC–AD 70), for his book reflects the liturgy then in use. Britannica.com .

Hosea 6:6 | Joel 2:32 Minute 28:07 to 29:00; and 31:40 to 35:40 | . | . Part 2 Amos and Obadiah . Background . Amos, the first Hebrew prophet to have a biblical book named for him. He accurately foretold the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (although he did not specify Assyria as the cause) and, as a prophet of doom, anticipated later Old Testament prophets. The little that is known about Amos’ life has been gleaned from his book, which was, in all likelihood, partly or wholly compiled by other hands. A native of Tekoa (now a ruin), 12 miles (19 km) south of Jerusalem, Amos flourished during the reigns of King Uzziah (c. 783–742 BC) of Judah (the southern kingdom) and King Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC) of Israel. By occupation, he was a shepherd; whether he was merely that or a man of some means is not certain. He actually preached for only a short time. Britannica.com . Book of Obadiah, also spelled Abdias, the fourth of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, in the Jewish canon treated as one book, The Twelve. Obadiah, with only one chapter consisting of 21 verses, is the shortest of all Old Testament books and purports to be a record of “the vision of Obadiah.” Nothing is known of the prophet except for his name, which means “servant of Yahweh.” In the book, Edom, a long-time enemy of Israel, is castigated for its refusal to help Israel repel foreigners who invaded and conquered Jerusalem. To many scholars this reference suggests a date of composition after the Babylonian conquest of 586 BC.

In this noisy, bustling, competitive world, what a privilege it is to have a sacred house where we may experience the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of the Lord. The element of selfishness crowds in upon us constantly. We need to overcome it, and there is no better way than to go to the house of the Lord and there serve in a vicarious relationship in behalf of those who are beyond the veil of death. What a remarkable thing this is. In most cases, we do not know those for whom we work. We expect no thanks. We have no assurance that they will accept that which we offer. But we go, and in that process we attain to a state that comes of no other effort. We literally become saviors on Mount Zion.* What does this mean? Just as our Redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side who have no means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf by those on earth.

But I know of no age limit described in the scriptures or guidelines announced by Church leaders restricting this important service to mature adults.

You need not wait until you reach an arbitrary age to fulfill your responsibility to assist in the work of salvation for the human family.

Jeremiah cried out to those same people on the brink of that exile and pleaded for their repentance. Lamentations, written by Jeremiah, presents a dirge as Judah went into exile.

Also, it can be kind fun to speculate what Ezekiel was seeing things that sound like engines, visors and planes. Ezekiel 1 has a revelation like vision. According to Old Testament manual “the full meaning of Ezekiel’s vision has not yet been revealed to us by the Lord”. 1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. the living creature was in the wheels. 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. .

From the lesson . “Commonly translated stick, the Hebrew word used is etz, a generic word meaning ‘wood’ (there are other words meaning ‘stick,’ ‘staff,’ ‘branch,’ or ‘scepter’). This was wood upon which it was possible to write. Babylonian writing tablets of wood have been found hinged together and faced with wax, with writing engraved on them. Two wooden tablets represent the scriptures from Judah (the Bible) and Joseph (the Book of Mormon) to ‘be one in mine hand’ (Ezek. 37:15–19 and fn.)” (A Latter-day Saint Commentary on the Old Testament [1993], 608). | In addition, while serving as an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, Keith Meservy commented on the discovery of some ancient wooden tablets: | “The discovery in 1953 of these writing boards from biblical Calah in Mesopotamia altered the thinking of scholars about how Middle Eastern cultures made records. Wooden tablets filled with wax represent the ‘earliest known form of ancient book’ and help us understand an important prophecy of Ezekiel foretelling the uniting of the Bible and Book of Mormon” (“Ezekiel’s Sticks and the Gathering of Israel,” Ensign, Feb. 1987, 4). | Ezekiel’s prophecy that the two sticks would be joined “one to another into one stick” (Ezekiel 37:17) is clarified by the phrase “shall grow together,” which is found in 2 Nephi 3:12. This phrase helps us understand that the joining together of the two sticks is a process that will occur over time. | Wooden tablets are put together and bound. | . .

            "content": "Isaiah and Prophesy . The Savior seems to be the center of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (BOM). . Great are the Words of Isaiah: 3 Nephi 23 1-3 | The Prophet Russel M Nelson loves the words of Isaiah, make the Sabbath a Delight: Isaiah 58 13-14 | Our Children need to learn of Isaiah, he talks of the Savior, there are prophesies of today Isaiah talks of Savior: Friend | Isaiah 61 1-3; Luke 4 17-21 | . Gentiles are Part of the Plan . The Gentiles are mentioned frequently. This makes me wonder about… why was it difficult for some of the original apostles when Paul branched out on his Sermons to Gentile lands?. Most of us are Gentiles!!! . Isaiah prophesied of the Gentiles. The Hebrew term goyim translated as “nations” in this passage can mean people in general but is more often translated as “Gentiles” in Isaiah for example, see … . Isaiah 11:10; | 42:1,6; | 49:6, 22; | 54:3; | 60:3, 5, 11, 16. | . Latter-day Saints find a fulfillment of the prophecy that Gentile nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord as they witness individuals and families from nations around the world enter temples to worship and receive temple ordinances. . It probably never occurred to Isaiah’s contemporaries that this prophecy spoke of Gentile nations actually building, entering, and ministering in the temple. | . . Temples and Gentiles are part of the Prophesy . Let’s think of counsel from the Prophet and Apostles from Conference in reference to Isaiah 56. Study talks by scholars on Isaiah and Temples: . Temples and Isaiah | Isaiah 56:1-2, 7-8 | . Chapter 56 of Isaiah seems to offer some clarification on the issue of Gentiles and Temple worship and perhaps offer some indication that someday that Gentiles could actually enter in the temple. . After admonishing the covenant people to “Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed” (56:1) | The Lord pronounces a blessing on those who follow his commandments, keep the Sabbath, and avoid doing evil (see 56:2). | .

Our Prophet opened the morning sessions stating . Godly power comes into the world with each new temple | . Find a Reference in Isaiah . Sunday morning talks were amazing to me. These talks reminded me of Isaiah, which was “my ask” during conference. Below are my notes from the talks as I listened. Look at these talks or others, extract a quote or topic then find it in Isaiah, See if this helps you, as it did me, to hear the voice of the prophets past and present. . Russel M Nelson : &quot;Isaiah, Covenants or Heavenly Power or Rest&quot; . We are constantly on the Prophets mind. He weeps over our heartaches. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are intimately aware of our needs. He testifies of their love. . Don’t curl up in PJs, there are so many things ahead. | We will see manifestation of the Saviors power in faithful lives. | Many feel overwhelmed or exhausted. Some leave Church because it requires too much. But, look for “rest”. Washington DC temple open house. Temple journey shows symbolism. A boy pointed to alter as a place of rest on temple journey. Covenant in Temple, Come upon me all you labour, I will give you rest… | . | Heavenly Power is reward for keeping covenants. This power leads our way. A special rest. | Savior has overcome the world. Savior wills that we will overcome the world. | Savior redeemed us from weakness, sin. Including arrogance, pride, anger, jealously fear. 1st What is overcoming the world? Give away are favorite sins. Overcoming the world means grow to love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. | 2nd How do we do it? Yield to the enticing of the Holy Ghost. Becometh a Saint. Living the gospel produces “Spiritual Momentum”. Do the spiritual work, Jesus Christ will lift us, pull us. | 3rd How does it bless our lives. Making covenants will come with opposition. But, we have access to Jesus Christ strength and redeeming power in our lives. | . | Urges us to take charge of our testimony of Jesus Christ. Continually strengthen and watch for miracles.

The Eternal Family Teaching Manual: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/the-eternal-family-teacher-manual/lesson-14-becoming-saviors-on-mount-zion?lang=eng . Isaiah is hard to Read . Isaiah is trying to help you visualize a scene, like a movie director. Isaiah is Poetry. Slow down, decompose the words. Look at other translations. Notice that the King James Version (KJV) does not show the poetic lines, but The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) does. Here are some comparisons of literary styles . . Types of Parallelism . Synonymous—Often the second line will help explain the first. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:31 | . 31 The strong shall become like tinder, and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them. . Emblematic—Ideas are compared by means of simile or metaphor. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:18 | . 18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. . Antithetic—The second line clarifies both ideas through contrast, like the color black next to white. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:19–20 | . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken . Synthetic or Completion—The second line completes the first, like a belt and buckle, in the form of . Question–Answer, or | Situation–Consequence, or | Proposition–Conclusion. | . Example: NSRV Isa 1:19 . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; . Chiasmus or Introverted—This word comes from Greek letter Χ (chi), which is the form it describes. The second line of the parallel is inverted. (Note: Often a chiasmus has many more than four lines.) . Example: NIV Isa 11:1 | . A) A shoot will come up B) from the stump of Jesse; B’) from his roots A’) a Branch will bear fruit. . Composite—each word or phrase (usually three or more) presents or expands upon a common theme, like spokes in a wheel. . Example: NSRV Isa 1:4 | . 4 Ah, sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, offspring who do evil, children who deal corruptly, who have forsaken the LORD, who have despised the Holy One of Israel, who are utterly estranged! . Climatic— Part of one line is treated in subsequent lines, culminating (or sometimes beginning) with the main point. . Example A (ending with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:7 | . 7 Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners. . Example B (beginning with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:8 | . 8. And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city. .",

How Great Thou Art . I struggle with pure Psalm reading, so I am always looking for new connections. As I make these connections, my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change.

What does this theme me to you? | Focus in on the image of Job talking to friends. Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends? | . . Job Part 1: Tragedy of Job . Job is a life known for overcoming trials. . Job 1:3… His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. | Job 1:6-12, according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat. Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships. | Job 1:14-19 the hardships start to happen. Theatrical adaptation to these versus in our reading. After each hardship we will have a (reporter) and the save (survivor) who says… “I only am escaped alone to tell thee”. | . 1st reporter … The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 2nd reporter … The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 3rd reporter … The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 4th reporter … Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. | . That is a lot to deal with, fortune and family in a seemingly short period of time. . Job Part 2: Recovery of Job . Job 2-41 is a whole bunch of poetry. More on the lamenting, and praising in the these books of Job is below. | Job 42:10,12-13,16 in the end, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Except children seem the same (why not twice as many children?) And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. | So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. | He had also seven sons and three daughters. | After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. | . | . Conversation between the Lord and Satan . The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary. . A former Lesson plan speaks about reading Job 1:6-12 in the roles of (Narrator, the Lord, and Satan). Let’s do it! | . The Script . Narrator: Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Whence comest thou? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: Doth Job fear God for nought? | Satan: Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. | Satan: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. . | Narrator: So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. | . The narrative indicates that Satan goes forward and inflicts trials on Job. Satan is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary”; these verses in Job 1 use the form hassatan, meaning “the adversary,” which describes the satan’s role here. . Much of this could be illustrative for us, as the reader. | The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering. | Any thoughts on this dialog? What do we think about it doctrinally? | . Background on the Book of Job . More on the Book of Job The book of Job has received much literary acclaim. | Why do the righteous suffer? | Questions arise, was Job and actual man? In scripture Job was an actual man and is referred to as a great prophet… Noah, Daniel, and Job exhibited great righteousness. | Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses). Perhaps as old as 1800 B.C. | How old was Job when he died? | . | . Reading Poetry in the Old Testament . I think Old Testament books when you get to Job and beyond are hard to read. The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings. While we are reading we are experiencing and thinking across boundaries ot time. Boundaries of perspectives. Come Follow me has an inserted section stating.. - Repetition of thoughts, parallelism, poetry - Hebrew language, different culture, different thoughts - According to my analytics Worm / Worms has 11 references in Job. Huh, worms!, Job 25:6 . Tennyson has been quoted as stating that the book of Job is “the greatest poem of ancient or modern times.” Of course, Tennyson was a poet… . And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers, &quot;&#39;Tis the fairy Lady of Shalott.&quot; . I am not Tennyson, but a Computer Scientist. Thus, I need to slow down with poetry. Fast with Code, but poetry requires cross references for me to see all the BITS of wisdom. You must analyze each word in the STANZA,POEM,DOGGEREL,CODE 😀. . Job 14:14-15 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. | Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. | . | Doctrine in Covenants 29:43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; | . | Mosiah 16:8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ. | He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. | Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil— | If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation | . | . My Top 4 poetic perspectives from Job . Job as indicated by picture is in dialog with his friends for the majority of the book of Job. For me, over the years I have highlighted a few items.

Additional notes: God is collaborative in other words we participate. Moses 7:29 Enoch ask how can God weep. God is weeping, while seeing his children suffer. This is a reformation of how we should view God, merciful and kind. Macrina The advance of the soul is through God’s love. Julian of Norwich And I was answered in my understanding: ‘It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.’ In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it. | . | Universalism, the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions … In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God … my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity. Edward Beecher,Satan is trying to destroy true nature of God and the Plan. | . | . | President Nelson Choices for Eternity First, know the truth about who you are. If Lord were to speak to you today… He would make sure you understand is your true identity. I am simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.” | Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you…. In short, They have offered you everything! God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you. | And third, know the truth related to your conversion. The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you. Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life. You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe. | . | For those that have experience with the Temple… What is the focus of the Temple in our relationship with God? Understanding our relationship with God? Understanding the nature of God? How do we learn to love the Lord through the temple? | History, Stories, and Miracles in Joshua and Judges . As I read these stories, I often want to know more about the archeology, history, and details that verify these events. Things like the Ark of the Covenant, the Levite Priests, the Bugles, and the “facts’ around them are fascinating to me. Usually, I think about Indiana Jones when I think of the Ark and this fantasy leads me to Wikipedia and its linked sources to explore and Journey into the past. Here are the stories that fascinate me… . Children of Israel Cross Jordan Joshua 3:13,15,17 | The Walls of Jericho Joshua 6:2-6, 6:20 | Ambush at Ai, Joshua 6:14-21 | Trumpets and Lights of Gideon versus the Midianites Judges 7:16,20-21 | Samson and Delilah, is this scripture/history? Judges 16 | *** Why did the children of Israel keep falling int idolatry aka People after Gideon I have heard it said that our children today have such a hard time, I have seen it and felt it personally. This goes to them “Lest we Forget” . As far as evidences of these stories, there are as many opportunities to believe or doubt, even the Children of Israel doubted. Here are some things that we should understand as we read these stories… . These books belong to the tradition of Jewish history and law, called Deuteronomic, they were first committed to writing about 550 BCE, during the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Ezra is contemporary with this time of this compilation. For reference, the time period of Joshua is closer to 1400 BCE. | The death of Moses is recorded in Deuteronomy 34, the death of Joshua is recorded in the book of Joshua 24. Many of the events we have today were created from either oral histories or fragments. | Scholars, Archeologists and others often differ in opinion on cities like Jericho and Ai and how their destructions reconcile with being at the time of Joshua. | Come Follow Me suggests finding gems. It describes these books as being referred to as “Historical” portions of the Old Testament. Thus, some of these stories can be gruesome, troubling, or just from a single perspective. Come Follow Me Source: Thoughts to Keep in Mind | Be aware that Joseph Smith and his work on the Bible. The big changes in Joshua are referring to the “True Attributes of God”. The Contribution of the JST to the Old Testament Historical Books The KJV reads, “For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly” (Joshua 11:20). The Prophet changed it to read, “For it was of the Lord to destroy them utterly because they hardened their hearts.” | . | The Story of Rahab . Joshua 2 Before the Israelites cross the Jordan, Joshua sends men to scout out the land. Arriving in Jericho, they decide to spend the night at the house of the harlot Rahab. When Jericho’s ruler tries to apprehend them, Rahab hides them and then helps them escape, thus saving their lives. In return, she and her household are spared the destruction of Jericho and Rahab and her family become part of the people Israel. . Rehab’s Purpose . Rahab’s Faith, Works . Rahab in the ancestry of Jesus . My interpretation of Rahab’s example… God saves, atones and loves those with a past. Brother Darcy provided amazing insight on his feelings into this atoning process. He understood that in his work in education within the prison he saw hunger, compared to his work in traditional work in education where he sees complacency and a focus on credit hours. Lives are often best changed with a reawakening, we don’t necessarily need to be a harlot or be in prison, but whatever prison we shackle upon ourself, we need to awaken unto God and use the quickening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. .",

Today we stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ, of his Resurrection, and the fulfillment of the Atonement. . | Josiah Drew on Good Friday and our experience Friday under full moon in Laguna Mountains and Kitchen Creek . | Jesus Lives . | Insights from Tad Callister on “The Infinite Atonement” coupled with Come Follow Me “Though His Atonement” scriptures . Satan has been successful in diverting much of the Christian world’s attention from the one doctrine that can save us, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to the ancillary doctrines that have meaning only because they draw their sustenance from this redeeming event. Like a skilled magician, Satan’s every move is to divert our attention and dilute our focus from the primary object at hand, namely Christ’s atoning sacrifice, in hopes we will turn exclusively to doctrines of secondary and far lesser import” (page 15). | “In the pre-mortal council the Savior covenanted with the Father to perform the Atonement. . . Based on that pledge or covenant we had faith in him. Based on that covenant the Father could promise remission of sins prior to the atoning sacrifice because he “knew” his Son would not fail. The issue was not that he could not break his covenant, but rather, that he would not” (page 74). Abraham 3 read verse 24. 25, 27. | So what is the Atonement, and why was the Fall of Adam and Eve so significant, even vital? Eve Moses 5:9–12, Were it not for our transgression… We never should have had seed | Never should have known good and evil | The joy of our redemption | The eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient | | Elder Callister state the purposes of the Atonement … To restore all that was lost in physical and spiritual death | To provide the opportunity to repent and overcome spiritual death | To allow us the potential to become a god or goddess. | | . | “The Savior observed every spiritual law with undeviating exactness apparently because of his compliance with each one, he received power upon power until he acquired the attributes of God, even in premortal ties. Such progress was a natural consequence of his exacting compliance. His godhood thus seemed to result not from a creation of these laws, but rather from compliance with them” (page 301). Moroni 10:32:33 shares how we become holy and without spot, which is the covenatn of the Father through Christ. | It is infinite in the blessings it bestows. The blessings of the Atonement extend far beyond its well-known triumph over physical and spiritual death. Some of these blessings overlap; some complement and supplement each other; but in the aggregate the effect of this event so blesses our lives in a multiplicity of ways, both known and yet to be discovered, that it might appropriately be said to be infinite in its blessing nature” (page 60). Romans 8:35-39 in life or death nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. | “One does not speak lightly of the Atonement or casually express his appreciation. It is the most sacred and sublime event in eternity. It deserves our most intense thoughts, our most profound feelings, and our noblest deeds. One speaks of it in reverential tones; one contemplates it in awe; one learns of it in solemnity. This event stands alone, now and throughout eternity. . . . “I now add my testimony to the many who have preceded me that his sacrifice was indeed an infinite and eternal Atonement” (pages 334-335). Doctrine &amp; Convenants 19:15-19 I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. | . | Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness By Sharon Eubank . Christ heals wounds. When tragedies overtake us, when life hurts so much we can’t breathe, when we’ve taken a beating like the man on the road to Jericho and been left for dead, Jesus comes along and pours oil into our wounds, lifts us tenderly up, takes us to an inn, looks after us. To those of us in grief, He says, “I will … ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, … that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.” | Christ is rest. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said: “It is not intended that we run faster than we have strength. … But [in spite of] that, I know … many of you run [very,] very fast and that [the] energy and emotional supply sometimes registers close to empty.” When expectations overwhelm us, we can step back and ask Heavenly Father what to let go of. Part of our life experience is learning what not to do. But even so, sometimes life can be exhausting. Jesus assures us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Christ is willing to join with us in the yoke and pull in order to lighten our burdens. | The Lord knows how hard you are trying. You are making progress. Keep going. He sees all your hidden sacrifices and counts them to your good and the good of those you love. Your work is not in vain. You are not alone. His very name, Emmanuel, means “God with us.” He is surely with you. | Christ sees us in our tree. For various reasons, we don’t feel accepted or acceptable. The New Testament shows the great efforts Jesus made to reach out to all kinds of people: lepers, tax collectors, children, Galileans, harlots, women, Pharisees, sinners, Samaritans, widows, Roman soldiers, adulterers, the ritually unclean. In almost every story, He is reaching someone who wasn’t traditionally accepted in society. Luke 19 tells the story of the chief tax collector in Jericho named Zacchaeus. He climbed a tree in order to see Jesus walk by. Zacchaeus was employed by the Roman government and viewed as corrupt and a sinner. Jesus saw him up in the tree and called to him, saying, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.” And when Jesus saw the goodness of Zacchaeus’s heart and the things he did for others, He accepted his offering, saying, “This day is salvation come to this house, [for] he also is a son of Abraham.” | . | .",

Cook 5 highlights First Love God - Post WWII by George Albet Smith, “reminded the Saints of the Savior’s invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies”. What do we think today as Russia invades Ukraine? Elder Holland, there is a quote that says “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” | Second Seek the Fruits of the Spirit - “will pitch our tents toward the temple”. This was reference to Lot and Abraham actions after parting ways and dividing land. In adversity, how do we avoid resentment? avoid the false coping strategies? | Third Excercise Agency to Choose Righteousness - “agency is at the heart of personal growth and experience”. How do we act in challenge? “all that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ”. My heart mourns for post missionary service and those that feel like they can’t recover from failing in their agency. Or members, who ultimately get to the Temple and suffer because of post Temple covenant breaking. My Testimony, I have experienced problems in my personal agencency because of “unfair circumstances”. Things can be made right throught the atonement. | Fourth Build Zion in our Hearts and Homes - “religious observance can “unleash the power of families … to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith.” I believe the pandemic was an opportunity for the Church to follow the prophet on “home-centered, church-supported religous observance”. As I have returned to school and have sat in equity, avoiding microagressions, and all lives matter type of meetings … It is my opinion, that our tolerance and love needs to increase, but also are covenant observance needs to be able to withstand all. I believe we live in a time similar to when Abraham was looking for 50 great souls to unite with him in faith and with God. Ultimately he could only could worship as a family. | Fifth Follow the Current Admonitions of Our Prophet - “feel enduring peace and joy, even in turbulent times”. I find it intrguing that Elder Cook says “Current Admonitions”. In turbulant time we don’t want to be Lot’s wife, perhaps that could be looking back at old admonitions by old prophets. Also, we need to feel joy and look ahead. Thoughts? | . |",

The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD. According to genealogies many biblical purest say Adam is 6000-10000 years old. | 2 Peter 3:8 … one day is with the Lord as a thousand years … | Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days … And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time. … | D&amp;C 77:6 speaks of temporal existence … the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence… W. W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | . Revelation continues, Restoration continues . Everyone will always be left to grapple between Wisdom of the World versus Wisdom of God. But the Gospel and Faith enable us to obtain continuous and pertinent revelation, even enlightenment if we study and ask. There are four accounts of creation in our scriptures 3 accounts, plus the temple. Abraham account says … ““We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.” | Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.) | Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed. | Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fullness. | In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man … And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth … Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. | . | .",

God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, Jesus rose again and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. . Child of God . I have a story. My story is that I came to earth; just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live. We all share an earthly experience. My excitement, to this story, is that I am a child of God. That my birth, entitled me to a divine spirit! I believe we all have that spirit and it directs us in every major decision and thought. In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine potential. Shortly after, my 19th year, two years were spent serving the people of England. There were many days walking down roads unknown and several opportunities to teach others something familiar, that “God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return”. I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of these restoring truths and observing others tuning into their divine spirit. Today, 40+ years later, I continue proclaim that same witnesses and that same spirit truth resides within each of us. . Continue in Faith . I have had 5 wonderful children. My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience. We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children. Tamara left this earth at age 42. My first 3 children and I survived, but suffered. In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior. I had a visit from Jesus in my dreams and he presented to me that my deceased wife Tamara had risen, as well as certain ancestors gone before. At that time, I needed the comfort of these tender and miraculous experiences. After two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life … I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and seeing someone familiar, Lora. Once again, love returned to my life, it came with a blended family, and my first biological son. As with Job in the Old Testament, in adversity “I know that my redeemer lives” and that “the latter end of my life has more than my beginning”. Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives, many divine connections, and always a continuing faith as child of God. .",
