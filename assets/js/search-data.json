Associate the Quote . My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness . Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy . However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise. So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation. .

My questions … Who has claimed to be the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof? Rome, United States? Any other speculation or opinions in references out there? | . | . ChatGPT Response . In the parable you described from Matthew 21:33-46, the householder represents God, the vineyard represents the kingdom of God, and the husbandmen represent the religious leaders or the people of Israel. The servants sent by the householder represent the prophets sent by God throughout history to the people of Israel, and the son represents Jesus Christ. The phrase in Matthew 21:43, &quot;The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,&quot; suggests a transfer of the blessings and responsibilities of the kingdom of God from the people of Israel (represented by the husbandmen) to another nation. This statement does not specifically mention any particular nation by name. Interpretations of this parable may vary among theologians and scholars. Some speculate that the nation mentioned could refer to the early Christian Church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers. Others may interpret it more symbolically, suggesting that it represents the establishment and spread of Christianity throughout the world beyond the borders of Israel. It is important to note that while the parable itself does not explicitly identify the nation to which the kingdom of God is given, it serves as a warning to the religious leaders of the time and emphasizes the rejection of Jesus, the Son of God, by the religious authorities. Ultimately, the interpretation of this parable and the identification of the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof can vary among individuals and scholars, and it is advisable to consult various theological perspectives and teachings for a comprehensive understanding. Can you find &quot;theological perspectives&quot; on this from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints? Certainly! The interpretation of the parable you mentioned, as viewed through the lens of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, can be found in the teachings of LDS Church leaders and scripture. Here are a few references that provide insights from a Latter-day Saint perspective: &quot;The House of Israel&quot; and &quot;the Gentiles&quot;: In LDS theology, the house of Israel represents the covenant people of God, which includes both the ancient Israelites and their descendants. The Gentiles refer to those who are not of the house of Israel. Latter-day Saint teachings often emphasize that the gathering of Israel and the spreading of the gospel are ongoing processes. The parable can be understood as a message that the blessings of the kingdom of God, including the gospel and priesthood authority, would be shared with people of all nations, both Israelite and Gentile. Book of Mormon: The Book of Mormon, considered scripture by Latter-day Saints, contains additional teachings and interpretations of the parable. For example, 3 Nephi 16:10 states that if the Gentiles reject the fullness of the gospel, it will be taken from them and given to the remnants of the house of Israel. This concept aligns with the parable&#39;s message of the transfer of blessings and responsibilities. Teachings of Church Leaders: Various talks and writings by LDS Church leaders offer insights into this parable. For instance, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a former Apostle of the LDS Church, addressed the parable in his book &quot;The Mortal Messiah.&quot; He discussed how the rejection of Jesus and His gospel by the religious leaders led to the inclusion of the Gentiles in receiving the blessings of the kingdom. It is important to note that individual interpretations and perspectives within the LDS Church may vary, and the official teachings of the Church are primarily found in its scriptures and statements from current Church leaders. Therefore, studying these sources can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the specific theological perspectives on this parable within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In my experience, Loving God sometimes is the lessor discussed of the two commandments - I would like to see if you can make an inference to our family humor. In a family discussion we talked about Loving God. In this discussion we talked about loving God in relation to commandments given to Moses, by our recollection we simply remembered “not to curse his name” and have “no other gods”. This led to dialog about “Model Trains”, “Computer Science” and “Korean TV Shows”. Can you determine why we drifted into that discussion? | . ChatGPT Response . Based on the information you provided, it seems that your family discussion about loving God in relation to the commandments given to Moses took an unexpected and humorous turn, leading to a conversation about unrelated topics such as model trains, computer science, and Korean TV shows. Humor often arises from unexpected connections or tangents in conversations. It&#39;s possible that someone in your family made a playful or humorous comment that sparked the discussion about these unrelated topics. The transition from discussing commandments to discussing seemingly unrelated hobbies and interests could be a lighthearted way of exploring the idea of what it means to love God in the context of various aspects of life, including personal hobbies and entertainment preferences. In essence, the conversation may have taken a humorous detour to highlight the idea that even in our interests and hobbies, we can find ways to express love for God and see connections to our faith. Humor can often serve as a way to bring joy, creativity, and unexpected perspectives into discussions. 2nd bit of Help to ChatGPT. Close to the family event. What if I provide you the hint to have &quot;no other Gods&quot; in relation to the humor? If the hint is to have &quot;no other Gods&quot; in relation to the humor and the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV shows, it could be inferred that the humorous connection is centered around the idea of having a strong or intense interest in these topics. The humor might stem from playfully exaggerating or jokingly suggesting that these hobbies or interests have become so important or captivating that they could be seen as competing with or taking the place of a person&#39;s devotion to God. In other words, the humorous implication could be that these topics or activities have become &quot;gods&quot; in a figurative sense, capturing a significant amount of attention or devotion. This kind of humor often arises when people find amusing ways to juxtapose mundane or unrelated topics with significant or sacred concepts, highlighting the contrast between the two. It allows for a lighthearted exploration of the balance between our passions and our spiritual priorities, reminding us not to let our interests overshadow our love and devotion to God. Feedback on response to ChatGPT. Nicely done. In dialog amongst the three off us Father said to Son, &quot;Model Trains&quot; is not a God. Mother said to Father &quot;Computer Science&quot; is not a God. Son said to Mother &quot;Korean TV&quot; is not a God. We had a good laugh. You were able to get to the inference very well. Thank you! I&#39;m glad I was able to accurately infer the humor in your family dialog. It sounds like a lighthearted and enjoyable moment, where the playfulness came from the contrast between the significance of having &quot;no other Gods&quot; and the humorous suggestion that these hobbies and interests were being treated as such. Humor can often bring people together and create shared moments of joy and connection. It seems like your family found a playful way to explore the balance between their interests and their spiritual priorities, all while sharing some laughter together. Such moments can help strengthen relationships and create lasting memories. If I ask the Lord, He will teach me (Part 2) . In reading the story in the New Testament of the Rich Young Man, told three times Matthew 19:16–22; Mark 10:17–22; Luke 18:18–23. Can you see how this relates to Model Trains, Computer Science, and Korean TV from our family story. | . ChatGPT Response . The story you mentioned from the New Testament, often referred to as the story of the &quot;Rich Young Ruler,&quot; can be found in Matthew 19:16–22, Mark 10:17–22, and Luke 18:18–23. This story involves a rich young man who approaches Jesus and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments, and the young man claims to have kept them since his youth. Jesus then instructs him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him, but the young man walks away saddened because he had great wealth. In relating this story to the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV from your family story, we can draw some connections: Model Trains: Just as the rich young man had possessions, including great wealth, model trains could be seen as a hobby or interest that involves material possessions. The story reminds us not to let our attachment to material things hinder our commitment to following Jesus. Computer Science: Similarly, computer science or any other profession or area of expertise can be seen as something we dedicate our time and energy to. The story reminds us that our commitment to following Jesus should take precedence over any worldly pursuits or attachments, including our professional endeavors. Korean TV: While Korean TV shows may not involve material possessions like model trains or a profession like computer science, the story highlights the importance of prioritizing our relationship with God over any personal interests or pleasures. It serves as a reminder that nothing should hinder our commitment to following Jesus, even if it means letting go of things that bring us enjoyment or entertainment. In summary, the story of the Rich Young Ruler prompts us to examine our priorities and reminds us to put our devotion to God above worldly attachments, whether they are material possessions, personal interests, or professional pursuits. 2nd question to ChatGPT.

The Laborers in the Vineyard . Matthew 20:1–16 is a parable about a householder who went out to hire laborers in the Vineyard agreeing to pay them a penny a day. The householder went out again at the 3rd, 6th, 9th hour and did likewise. Finally, he went out at the 11th hour an questioned those who stood idle, he found out that no one hath hired them. he hired laborers through the day, evensome at the 11th hour, every man receiving a penny. Does anyone relate to this story, either by being and early hire or a late hire? . Jeffrey Holland Talk . “My friends, I am not being unfair to you. You agreed on the wage for the day, a good wage. You were very happy to get the work, and I am very happy with the way you served. You are paid in full. Take your pay and enjoy the blessing. May I plead with us not to be hurt—and certainly not to feel envious—when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon. This parable—like all parables—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. So if you have made covenants, keep them. If you haven’t made them, make them. If you have made them and broken them, repent and repair them. It is never too late so long as the Master of the vineyard says there is time. Please listen to the prompting of the Holy Spirit telling you right now, this very moment, that you should accept the atoning gift of the Lord Jesus Christ and enjoy the fellowship of His labor.

He said, “President, do you think I have truly been forgiven?” Now my tears accompanied his. Before me stood a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ who had given his all to teaching and testifying about the Savior. He was the embodiment of the healing and strengthening power of the Savior’s Atonement. I said, “Danny! Have you looked in the mirror? Have you seen your eyes? They are filled with light, and you are beaming with the Spirit of the Lord. Of course you have been forgiven! You are amazing! Now what you need to do is move forward with your life. Don’t look back! Look forward with faith to the next ordinance.” ChatGPT From a Christian perspective, this statement carries a symbolic meaning. The &quot;stone&quot; represents Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the cornerstone or foundation stone in biblical imagery.

John 8:1-11 It seems to have profoundly impacted John as he wrote “And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.”, referring to Jesus. As I read this story, writting on the ground impacted on me. It helped me greatly with my own story, where I felt caught in the middle of two loved ones. . This story is about allowing only “family” to an upcoming “family reunion”. This rule, I believe, is based off of our Patriarch for the reunion (pictured) likely using “The Family Proclamation” as his guide.

They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus” | My attempt at a Peacemaker statement… “Lora and I will pray for a change of heart” | Support of Reunion and purpose… “In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents.” | Clair’s Response… “I understand.

The reading of the parable and the family discussion were synchronous in timing in my life. In this event, I was so proud of Claire’s response.

This seems to be a straightforward parable. Any deeper interpretaions? . ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Good Shepherd is a powerful and deeply symbolic image of Christ as our loving and protective shepherd who leads us to safety and salvation. While the parable can be understood on a literal level as a story about sheep and a shepherd, it also has several deeper meanings and interpretations. . One interpretation of the parable is that the sheep represent humanity and the shepherd represents Christ. The sheep who recognize and follow the shepherd’s voice represent those who have accepted Christ as their Savior and have a personal relationship with Him. The sheep who do not recognize the shepherd’s voice represent those who have not yet accepted Christ or who have strayed from the path of righteousness. . Another interpretation of the parable is that the shepherd represents the leadership of the Church, and the sheep represent the members of the Church. The parable emphasizes the importance of following the guidance and direction of Church leaders, who are called to be shepherds and watch over the spiritual well-being of the members. . The parable also emphasizes the love and care that the shepherd has for his sheep. Christ’s willingness to lay down his life for his sheep represents his ultimate sacrifice on the cross for the salvation of humanity. The parable also highlights the importance of each individual sheep, as the shepherd is willing to leave the 99 to search for and rescue the one lost sheep. .

ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Foolish Rich Man is a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and materialism. The rich man in the story was so focused on accumulating wealth and enjoying his own pleasures that he neglected to consider the needs of others, and he ultimately lost everything. . In terms of modern interpretation regarding retirement, the parable can be seen as a warning against being overly focused on accumulating wealth and material possessions, and instead encourages a focus on investing in things that truly matter, such as relationships, experiences, and spiritual growth. . While saving for retirement is important, the parable suggests that our ultimate treasures should be things that are not subject to the uncertainties of life, such as a strong relationship with God and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This may mean investing time and resources into charitable causes or community involvement, rather than simply accumulating wealth for ourselves. . In addition, the parable emphasizes the importance of being prepared for unexpected events or emergencies, as the rich man was not prepared for his sudden death and lost everything. This can be interpreted as a call to be prudent in financial planning, and to have contingency plans in place for unexpected events. . Overall, the Parable of the Foolish Rich Man reminds us to keep our priorities in order, and to focus on investing in things that truly matter and bring lasting fulfillment, rather than being consumed by the pursuit of wealth and material possessions. . The great supper Luke 14:12–24 . No one is showing up to the supper, they all have an excuses. Since I serve as a Missionary, sometimes I had this thought. The key to story is probably that we attend the supper. Any other thoughts? . ChatGPT assistance… The Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14:12-24) tells the story of a man who throws a great banquet and invites many guests. However, when the time comes for the banquet, all of the guests make excuses and decline the invitation. The host becomes angry and sends his servant out into the streets to invite anyone and everyone to the banquet, regardless of their social standing. The servant returns with a diverse group of guests, and the banquet is a success. . The key message of the parable is that the invitation to the banquet represents the invitation to salvation and eternal life with God, and that many people will make excuses and refuse the invitation. The parable highlights the importance of accepting the invitation and responding to God’s call, and warns of the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ. . As a missionary, you may have encountered people who make excuses or refuse to consider the message of the gospel. The parable is a reminder that not everyone will respond positively to the invitation, and that rejection and indifference are common responses. However, the parable also offers hope in the form of the second group of guests who accept the invitation and enjoy the banquet. This group represents those who respond to the gospel message with faith and obedience, and who will ultimately be rewarded with eternal life. . Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of accepting God’s invitation to salvation and living a life of faith and obedience. It also highlights the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ. As a missionary, you can share this message with others and invite them to accept the invitation to the great banquet of eternal life with God. . The unjust steward Luke 16:1–12 . A lesson in stewardship, “faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much”. . ChatGPT assistance… Yes, the Parable of the Unjust Steward (Luke 16:1-12) is a well-known story told by Jesus. It’s a challenging parable that has been interpreted in a number of ways by scholars and theologians over the years. . In the parable, a rich man discovers that his steward (manager) has been squandering his possessions. The rich man calls the steward to account and tells him that he will be fired. The steward then goes to his master’s debtors and reduces the amount they owe in order to make friends for himself, perhaps hoping that these debtors will help him out when he loses his job. . Jesus concludes the parable by saying that the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted shrewdly. Jesus then goes on to say, “For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations” (Luke 16:8-9, KJV). . Many scholars interpret this parable as a lesson in shrewdness or wise use of resources. Jesus is not commending the steward for his dishonesty but rather for his shrewdness in using his remaining time and resources to prepare for the future. Jesus is urging his followers to use their resources wisely in order to prepare for their eternal destiny. . Other scholars interpret the parable as a lesson in stewardship, as you mentioned. Jesus is teaching that those who are faithful in small matters will also be faithful in larger ones. The steward was unfaithful in his management of his master’s possessions, but he was shrewd in using his remaining time to make amends. Jesus is urging his followers to be faithful and responsible in all areas of life, including the use of their resources and possessions. . Overall, the Parable of the Unjust Steward is a challenging story that requires careful interpretation. However, one clear message that emerges is the importance of wise use of resources and faithful stewardship in all areas of life. . The rich man and Lazarus Luke 16:19–31 . Lazarus (a beggar) and the rich man die, there is a dialog with Father Abraham and Lazarus. Interestingly, the rich man attempts to work up a plan to save his family. Does this make us think there is hope for rich man? Was Jesus hinting at this? . ChatGPT assistance… In the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), the rich man and Lazarus die, and their fates in the afterlife are drastically different. Lazarus is carried by the angels to Abraham’s side, while the rich man is tormented in Hades. In the dialogue between the rich man and Abraham, the rich man pleads for mercy and relief from his torment, and he also asks Abraham to send Lazarus to his father’s house to warn his five brothers so they will not end up in the same place of torment. . The fact that the rich man is concerned for his family members and their fate suggests that he is not entirely without compassion or concern for others. However, the parable does not offer any explicit indication of the rich man’s spiritual state or his ultimate fate. It’s possible that Jesus included this detail to emphasize the importance of warning others about the reality of judgment and eternal consequences. The rich man’s concern for his brothers may be seen as a reminder that we should also be concerned about the spiritual welfare of those around us. . Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and caring for those who are in need. While it’s possible to interpret the rich man’s concern for his family as a sign of hope for his salvation, the parable does not provide a clear answer on the matter. Ultimately, the parable serves as a warning about the reality of judgment and the importance of living a life that reflects our faith and commitment to God. .",

It’s hard to imagine the anguish Jesus Christ’s followers must have felt on the day after His death. The night before, His body had been lovingly prepared and placed in a garden tomb. Now they were left to figure out how life could possibly go on without Him. Almost certainly His death had taken something from them, but what they had lost was nothing compared to all that His life had given. Whether they understood it or not, Jesus Christ had forged a new path forward for all who would follow Him, one lit by a hope that shines brighter than any darkness we may encounter. .

            "content": "Introduction Matthew 8; Mark 2–4; Luke 7 . Hospitality, in Ancient Israel, was considered a very important virture. It was common to extend hospitality to travelers and guests. It was also common for people to eat together in groups. Meals were often shared on low tables, with guest reclining on cushions or mats. Reading from My Jewish Learning and from personal experience I believe that this custom continues in certain cultures … There is reference in this to Abraham, Sarah, and three travelers that informed Sarah that she would have a child. Opening home and sitting down to a meals is an amazing opportunity to learn. . Nov 11, 2007 email from John to Lora… BYU (campus) was closed, church was on Saturday. I started walking at the top of Mount of Olives. Found a really friendly man who invited me to his house. There were all kinds of people living (or staying) there (socilaizing and passing through). This was probably the highlight of my day but I was anxious to see the sites. . In retrospec March 2023, perhaps I should have lingered to better understand what it meant when Jesus sat to meat. Enjoying meal and spending time with fellow travelers and the owner of the house. . . Publicans, They sat down to meat . The term sat down to meat is an old-fashioned way to say they had a meal together. The “meat” could refer to any type of food, not specifically animal flesh. There is something timeless about sharing a meal together and breaking bread with others. . Mathew 9:9-13 A man named Mathew . 9 ¶ And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. . 10 ¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. . 11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? . 12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. . 13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. . | Mark 2:13-17 He saw Levi . 14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. . 15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. . 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? . 17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. . | Luke 5:27-32 All accounts mention the Publican and Follow me . 27 ¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. . 28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him. . 29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. . 30 But their scribes and *Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? . 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. . 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. . | . Pharisees, They sat down to meat . Eating with Pharisees was breaking with social norms at the time. Because of customs and the open nature of breaking bread … A woman knew that Jesus was at the Pharisse’s house and brought an alabaster box. She performed the act of washing Jesus’s feet, which is considered a sign humility and service. This act was a powerfuls symbol of devotion and love … Jesus used this event to teach, which could be seen as a challenge to the Pharisee’s authourity. Notice how he talks to Simon, this is Simon the Pharisee, not the apostle. . . Luke 7:36-50 . 36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. . 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, . 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. . 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. . 40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. . 41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. . 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? . 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. . 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. . 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. . 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. . 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. . 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. . 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? . 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. . Commentary. Thy faith hath saved thee is the theme for the week in Come Follow Me. This story of the Woman emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus as a means of salvation. It also highlights the power of repentance, humility, and love towards God as the way to receive God’s forgiveness and mercy. Overall, this story shows that no matter how great one’s sins may be, God’s love and forgiveness are available to all. . Palsy Miracles, I have not found so great faith . At the time of Jesus, “palsy” was a broad term used to describe a range of conditions that caused muscle weakness, such as stroke, cerebral palsy, or other neurological disorders. Today palsy could be used to describe “cerebral palsy” or “parkinsons”, things that impact muscle movement. Most of these speckic palsies have treatments today to remediate symptoms, but do not have cures. . | Matthew 8:5-13, As thou hast believed, referring to the Centerian .. not the servant who was sick with Palsy . 5 ¶ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, . 6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. . 7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. . 8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. . 9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. . 10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. . 11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. . 12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. . 13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. . Commentary and Parallels. Unrelated to Palsy specifically, but related to the dreaded disease Cancer which we don’t find in the New Testament and from my life experiences in 1984… I was engaged to be married. My financee contracted lymphoma, a cancer, she left our engaged location of Los Angeles to take treatment and be with her family in San Antonio. . It took about 6 months ‘till we both had the courage to have her return and proceed with our plans for a Temple Marriage. | We had many instances of faith by others, fasting by members of ward, and little children praying for her in her primary. | She stated that as she took out her endowments that she felt a healing come over her. | A few days prior to the Temple Endowment and Marriage the Doctor said there was no progress in the cancer, after 6+ months. | After we returned from honeymoon, two weeks from prior visit, there were no signs of cancer. | In this event, I witnessed great faith, faith by others, and a miracle | However, my belief at the time was that things were supposed to be that way. Though amazed, still | The doctors said they saw no cancer, but asked that Chemo and Radiation treatments continue just in case. | There were many hardships and loses in this period of “just in case treatments” | 20 years later, 2004 there were complications, “Mesothelioma”. Again there was fasting. | During this blessing, I reflected on something much different than our previous miracle, a moment in which I gave a blessing to a dying man | Understanding Palsy or Cancer is very difficult, even for us today. Both palsy and cancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors. | Factors of life and environment can cause storms and tempest in our lives, even death. | . | . . Mark 2:1-12, When Jesus saw their faith, the entire party . 1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. . 2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. . 3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. . 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. . 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. . 6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, . 7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? . 8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? . 9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? . 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) . 11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. . 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. . Commentary. The statement “We never saw it on this fashion” can be interpreted in a few different ways. One possibility is that the people who witnessed this miracle were amazed by the faith and persistence of the man’s friends, who went to great lengths to bring him to Jesus. It’s possible that the faith of the man’s friends were empowered by the Holy Spirit, enabling them to perform this incredible act of bringing their friend to Jesus. . They may have also been astonished by the power and authority that Jesus demonstrated in healing the man, both in forgiving his sins and physically restoring him to health. The fact that Jesus forgave the paralyzed man’s sins before physically healing him is significant, as it shows that Jesus saw the man’s spiritual condition as equally important as his physical condition. By forgiving the man’s sins, Jesus was able to fully restore him both physically and spiritually, making him “whole” in every sense of the word. . This may be why the people who witnessed this miracle were so amazed and exclaimed, “We never saw it on this fashion.” They may have been used to seeing physical healings, but the fact that Jesus was able to heal the man’s soul as well was truly extraordinary. It demonstrated Jesus’ unique power and authority as a spiritual healer and showed that he was indeed the “physician” who could make people whole again. . | . Whereas I was blind, now I see . Most of us have underlying faith in Jesus. Many of us try to live our lives according to a code of conduct in order to give and receive of his Grace. But, we don’t get peace through a single miracle. I often wonder, what did these ancient recipients do after their healings? . . John 9:25, There is a miracle in which we have followup from the person healed. The man who was blind from birth, testified and taught. The Pharises interviewed and cast him out… . 25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. . | John 9:29-34, The healed declares “him he heareth” . 29 (Pharises) We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. . 30 (Healed) The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. . 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. . 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. . 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. . 34 (Pharises) They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. . | John 9:35-38, Jesus comforts those in need . 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? . 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? . 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. . 38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. . Commentary. This story gives me a lot of peace. The blind man was lacking in knowledge and understanding. The man knew he was healed and perceived it must have been from God, but he still needed a to believe. The ability to worship him came in the second encounter with Jesus. . | . Even the Winds Obey His Will . We are very human. We can break bread, serve with God, receive miracles, and then still fall into our humanisms. All things are anticipated: a lost job, health problems, prodigal children, loss of a loved one, and then are very own declining and death. These are the storms. . . Mark 4:35-41, Right after the teaching of The sower, The mustard seed, etc, Essentially, this could be right after Church or Conference. . 35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. . 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. . 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. . 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? . 39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. . 40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? . 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? . Commentary. Peace, be Still in the hymn Master, the Tempest is Raging is related to its biblical origin, it is expanded to include the idea of Jesus bringing peace and comfort to all areas of our lives, not just literal storms at sea. . The hymn asks Jesus to speak peace to our troubled souls and to still the storms of our lives. | It expresses the faith that, just as Jesus was able to calm the winds and the waves, he is able to calm our fears and anxieties and bring us peace. | . | .",

The toughest commandment, Matthew 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. . President Nelson, Perfection Pending states, … the term perfect was translated from the Greek teleios, which means “complete.” Teleios is an adjective derived from the noun telos, which means “end.” The infinitive form of the verb is teleiono, which means “to reach a distant end, to be fully developed, to consummate, or to finish.” Please note that the word does not imply “freedom from error”; it implies “achieving a distant objective.” In fact, when writers of the Greek New Testament wished to describe perfection of behavior—precision or excellence of human effort—they did not employ a form of teleios; instead, they chose different words. … Teleios is not a total stranger to us. From it comes the prefix tele that we use every day. Telephone literally means “distant talk.” Television means “to see distantly.” Telephoto means “distant light,” and so on. | Moroni 10:32-33 teaches “Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; … love God with all your might, mind and strength … [Then] ye may be perfect in Christ, … holy, [and] without spot.” | .

Background . Book of Hosea, also spelled Osee, the first of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, considered as one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. According to the superscription, Hosea began his prophetic activity during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC). His prophetic announcements indicate that he was active until near the fall (721 BC) of the northern kingdom of Israel, the scene of his entire ministry. The text is quite corrupt and contains difficult problems of interpretation. Yahweh’s compassion for Israel, however, is generally the dominant theme. Having “played the harlot” with Canaanite rites and practices, Israel will surely experience Yahweh’s wrath, but not forever. Yahweh will welcome Israel like a husband who takes back an unfaithful wife. Britannica.com . Book of Joel, second of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets. The Jewish canon lumps all together as The Twelve and divides Joel into four chapters; Christian versions combine chapters 2 and 3. The book relates nothing about Joel except his name and that of his father. An analysis of the text further indicates that Joel lived during the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 BC–AD 70), for his book reflects the liturgy then in use. Britannica.com .

Hosea 6:6 | Joel 2:32 Minute 28:07 to 29:00; and 31:40 to 35:40 | . | . Part 2 Amos and Obadiah . Background . Amos, the first Hebrew prophet to have a biblical book named for him. He accurately foretold the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (although he did not specify Assyria as the cause) and, as a prophet of doom, anticipated later Old Testament prophets. The little that is known about Amos’ life has been gleaned from his book, which was, in all likelihood, partly or wholly compiled by other hands. A native of Tekoa (now a ruin), 12 miles (19 km) south of Jerusalem, Amos flourished during the reigns of King Uzziah (c. 783–742 BC) of Judah (the southern kingdom) and King Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC) of Israel. By occupation, he was a shepherd; whether he was merely that or a man of some means is not certain. He actually preached for only a short time. Britannica.com . Book of Obadiah, also spelled Abdias, the fourth of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, in the Jewish canon treated as one book, The Twelve. Obadiah, with only one chapter consisting of 21 verses, is the shortest of all Old Testament books and purports to be a record of “the vision of Obadiah.” Nothing is known of the prophet except for his name, which means “servant of Yahweh.” In the book, Edom, a long-time enemy of Israel, is castigated for its refusal to help Israel repel foreigners who invaded and conquered Jerusalem. To many scholars this reference suggests a date of composition after the Babylonian conquest of 586 BC. Others, noting the anti-Edomite sentiments in II Kings 8:20–22, consider a date as early as the 9th century BC also probable. Britannica.com . Theme 1: The Lord Reveals Truth Through his Prophets . How do you hear Christ? Do you have an example of a pertinent revelation from the Prophet? Are we prophets in any way? . Amos 3:7 JST uses word “until he revealeth”.

In this lesson, students will learn how the spirit of Elijah motivates us to participate in family history work and to become “saviours … on mount Zion” (Obadiah 1:21). | . | 2004 October General Conference closing remarks by Gordon B Hinckley Most of our temples could be much busier than they are. In this noisy, bustling, competitive world, what a privilege it is to have a sacred house where we may experience the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of the Lord. The element of selfishness crowds in upon us constantly. We need to overcome it, and there is no better way than to go to the house of the Lord and there serve in a vicarious relationship in behalf of those who are beyond the veil of death. What a remarkable thing this is. In most cases, we do not know those for whom we work. We expect no thanks. We have no assurance that they will accept that which we offer. But we go, and in that process we attain to a state that comes of no other effort. We literally become saviors on Mount Zion.* What does this mean? Just as our Redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side who have no means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf by those on earth. ( - The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn, David Bednar | The Spirit of Elijah foretold by Moroni in his initial instructions to Joseph Smith and “But what is the object of [the coming of Elijah]? or how is it to be fulfilled? The keys are to be delivered, the spirit of Elijah is to come, the Gospel to be established, the Saints of God gathered, Zion built up, and the Saints to come up as saviors on Mount Zion [see Obadiah 1:21]. | Many of you may think family history work is to be performed primarily by older people. But I know of no age limit described in the scriptures or guidelines announced by Church leaders restricting this important service to mature adults.

You need not wait until you reach an arbitrary age to fulfill your responsibility to assist in the work of salvation for the human family.

The books of the prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Isaiah spoke to the nation of Judah about 150 years before their exile into Babylonia and called them to be faithful to God. Jeremiah cried out to those same people on the brink of that exile and pleaded for their repentance. Lamentations, written by Jeremiah, presents a dirge as Judah went into exile.

As a family, we read chapters 1 to 3, Shay really perked up on chapter 1. In reading the scripture, we need to enter into their zone. Try to be in the spirit of the people of that day. Also, it can be kind fun to speculate what Ezekiel was seeing things that sound like engines, visors and planes. Ezekiel 1 has a revelation like vision. According to Old Testament manual “the full meaning of Ezekiel’s vision has not yet been revealed to us by the Lord”. 1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. the living creature was in the wheels. 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. .

From the lesson . “Commonly translated stick, the Hebrew word used is etz, a generic word meaning ‘wood’ (there are other words meaning ‘stick,’ ‘staff,’ ‘branch,’ or ‘scepter’). This was wood upon which it was possible to write. Babylonian writing tablets of wood have been found hinged together and faced with wax, with writing engraved on them. Two wooden tablets represent the scriptures from Judah (the Bible) and Joseph (the Book of Mormon) to ‘be one in mine hand’ (Ezek. 37:15–19 and fn.)” (A Latter-day Saint Commentary on the Old Testament [1993], 608). | In addition, while serving as an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, Keith Meservy commented on the discovery of some ancient wooden tablets: | “The discovery in 1953 of these writing boards from biblical Calah in Mesopotamia altered the thinking of scholars about how Middle Eastern cultures made records. Wooden tablets filled with wax represent the ‘earliest known form of ancient book’ and help us understand an important prophecy of Ezekiel foretelling the uniting of the Bible and Book of Mormon” (“Ezekiel’s Sticks and the Gathering of Israel,” Ensign, Feb. 1987, 4). | Ezekiel’s prophecy that the two sticks would be joined “one to another into one stick” (Ezekiel 37:17) is clarified by the phrase “shall grow together,” which is found in 2 Nephi 3:12. This phrase helps us understand that the joining together of the two sticks is a process that will occur over time. | Wooden tablets are put together and bound. | . .

Gentiles are Part of the Plan . The Gentiles are mentioned frequently. This makes me wonder about… why was it difficult for some of the original apostles when Paul branched out on his Sermons to Gentile lands?. Most of us are Gentiles!!! . Isaiah prophesied of the Gentiles. The Hebrew term goyim translated as “nations” in this passage can mean people in general but is more often translated as “Gentiles” in Isaiah for example, see … . Isaiah 11:10; | 42:1,6; | 49:6, 22; | 54:3; | 60:3, 5, 11, 16. | . Latter-day Saints find a fulfillment of the prophecy that Gentile nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord as they witness individuals and families from nations around the world enter temples to worship and receive temple ordinances. . It probably never occurred to Isaiah’s contemporaries that this prophecy spoke of Gentile nations actually building, entering, and ministering in the temple. | . . Temples and Gentiles are part of the Prophesy . Let’s think of counsel from the Prophet and Apostles from Conference in reference to Isaiah 56. Study talks by scholars on Isaiah and Temples: . Temples and Isaiah | Isaiah 56:1-2, 7-8 | .

The Eternal Family Teaching Manual: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/the-eternal-family-teacher-manual/lesson-14-becoming-saviors-on-mount-zion?lang=eng . Isaiah is hard to Read . Isaiah is trying to help you visualize a scene, like a movie director. Isaiah is Poetry. Slow down, decompose the words. Look at other translations. Notice that the King James Version (KJV) does not show the poetic lines, but The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) does. Here are some comparisons of literary styles . . Types of Parallelism . Synonymous—Often the second line will help explain the first. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:31 | . 31 The strong shall become like tinder, and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them. . Emblematic—Ideas are compared by means of simile or metaphor. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:18 | . 18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. . Antithetic—The second line clarifies both ideas through contrast, like the color black next to white. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:19–20 | . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken . Synthetic or Completion—The second line completes the first, like a belt and buckle, in the form of . Question–Answer, or | Situation–Consequence, or | Proposition–Conclusion. | . Example: NSRV Isa 1:19 . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; . Chiasmus or Introverted—This word comes from Greek letter Χ (chi), which is the form it describes. The second line of the parallel is inverted. (Note: Often a chiasmus has many more than four lines.) . Example: NIV Isa 11:1 | . A) A shoot will come up B) from the stump of Jesse; B’) from his roots A’) a Branch will bear fruit. . Composite—each word or phrase (usually three or more) presents or expands upon a common theme, like spokes in a wheel. . Example: NSRV Isa 1:4 | . 4 Ah, sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, offspring who do evil, children who deal corruptly, who have forsaken the LORD, who have despised the Holy One of Israel, who are utterly estranged! . Climatic— Part of one line is treated in subsequent lines, culminating (or sometimes beginning) with the main point. . Example A (ending with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:7 | . 7 Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners. . Example B (beginning with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:8 | . 8. And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city. .",

How Great Thou Art . I struggle with pure Psalm reading, so I am always looking for new connections. As I make these connections, my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change. Not by just through reading, but by trying to connect to them in other ways. In Sabre Spring history, one Sunday, we had Alex Boye visit us and proclaim and testify of this Psalm/Hymn. As he sings, imagine this at our chapel pulpit. Also, follow along with the words on the page. Compare with the Psalm, Alex Boye accompanied by Mark Smith. . Psalms 8 How Great Thou Art . 1 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; | 1 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder; Consider all the works Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed!, | . 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! | 2 When thru the woods and forest glades I wander; And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur; And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, | . 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: | 4 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation; And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! . As a ward, most of us were uplifted by our exposure to “How Great thou Art” by Alex Boye. In my study, to understand that the inspiration for this Hymn came from Psalm 8, can really connect me back to these ancient believers. It also reminded me of my daughter, Claire, getting invited to a special fireside that night by Alex Boye; it was and is an amazing connection across modern culture to 2500 years ago. . Modern Psalmist . I love our Tabernacle choir. Conference with the choir, finding Mustache guy and debating about the four armed Organ player are part of our families conference tradition.

Psalms 23 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . 1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. . A psalm is defined as a sacred song or hymn. Psalms are sung at with musical accompaniment in churches and temples. Name some instruments we saw in this brief segment?

Are the Psalms Doctrine? . The Psalms are the hymnbook of the Old Testament Jews. In other words, they are prayers and praise to God. Most of them were written by King David of Israel.

According to Jewish tradition, the Book of Psalms was composed by the First Man (Adam), Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses(1), David(73+), Solomon(2), Heman(1), Jeduthun, Asaph(12), and the three sons of Korah(11).

The Judgments of Job, by Joseph Brickey, director of the Beaux-Arts Academy, resides in Lindon, Utah . Theme and Picture . Read the statement Yet Will I Trust in Him which is the lesson theme. What does this theme me to you? | Focus in on the image of Job talking to friends. Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends? | . . Job Part 1: Tragedy of Job . Job is a life known for overcoming trials. . Job 1:3… His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. | Job 1:6-12, according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat. Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships. | Job 1:14-19 the hardships start to happen. Theatrical adaptation to these versus in our reading. After each hardship we will have a (reporter) and the save (survivor) who says… “I only am escaped alone to tell thee”. | . 1st reporter … The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 2nd reporter … The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 3rd reporter … The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 4th reporter … Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. | . That is a lot to deal with, fortune and family in a seemingly short period of time. . Job Part 2: Recovery of Job . Job 2-41 is a whole bunch of poetry. More on the lamenting, and praising in the these books of Job is below. | Job 42:10,12-13,16 in the end, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Except children seem the same (why not twice as many children?) And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. | So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. | He had also seven sons and three daughters. | After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. | . | . Conversation between the Lord and Satan . The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary. . A former Lesson plan speaks about reading Job 1:6-12 in the roles of (Narrator, the Lord, and Satan). Let’s do it! | . The Script . Narrator: Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Whence comest thou? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: Doth Job fear God for nought? | Satan: Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. | Satan: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. . | Narrator: So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. | . The narrative indicates that Satan goes forward and inflicts trials on Job. Satan is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary”; these verses in Job 1 use the form hassatan, meaning “the adversary,” which describes the satan’s role here. . Much of this could be illustrative for us, as the reader. | The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering. | Any thoughts on this dialog? What do we think about it doctrinally? | . Background on the Book of Job . More on the Book of Job The book of Job has received much literary acclaim. | Why do the righteous suffer? | Questions arise, was Job and actual man? In scripture Job was an actual man and is referred to as a great prophet… Noah, Daniel, and Job exhibited great righteousness. | Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses). Perhaps as old as 1800 B.C. | How old was Job when he died? | . | . Reading Poetry in the Old Testament . I think Old Testament books when you get to Job and beyond are hard to read. The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings. While we are reading we are experiencing and thinking across boundaries ot time. Boundaries of perspectives. Come Follow me has an inserted section stating.. - Repetition of thoughts, parallelism, poetry - Hebrew language, different culture, different thoughts - According to my analytics Worm / Worms has 11 references in Job. Huh, worms!, Job 25:6 . Tennyson has been quoted as stating that the book of Job is “the greatest poem of ancient or modern times.” Of course, Tennyson was a poet… . And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers, &quot;&#39;Tis the fairy Lady of Shalott.&quot; . I am not Tennyson, but a Computer Scientist. Thus, I need to slow down with poetry. Fast with Code, but poetry requires cross references for me to see all the BITS of wisdom. You must analyze each word in the STANZA,POEM,DOGGEREL,CODE 😀. . Job 14:14-15 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. | Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. | . | Doctrine in Covenants 29:43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; | . | Mosiah 16:8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ. | He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. | Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil— | If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation | . | . My Top 4 poetic perspectives from Job . Job as indicated by picture is in dialog with his friends for the majority of the book of Job. For me, over the years I have highlighted a few items. As we have read it again as a family these still resonate with me… . Are you listening Job 7:17 | Worldly thinking Job 21:15 | Spirit in Man Job 32:7-9 | I know Job 19:25-26 | .",

The “Ancients” at the time of Moses | Those that lived at the meridian of time of shortly after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, inspired by Givens fireside in May | And, the modern Church revelations and very recent Prophet statements today | We have been counseled through Come Follow Me, to find the Gems in the Old Testament. . My reflections of the Ancients to today were completely unified as I look toward the spirit. In Deuteronomic period of history, we see so much crisis; today we see similar crisis. In the Deuteronomic period we see that with God we can prevail. Today, I see that the Children of Israel “like miracles” can be found in through our obedience to the modern Prophet. . Many of us believe, we can feel the closeness of the Savior as did Peter, Paul, and the Apostles after the Savior was resurrected. We have a Prophet, that has provided us the recent “Spiritual Momentum” guidance. In this guidance, by repentance and allowing forgiveness to enter our hearts we will receive joy! We may not see a completeness… We may wish for more guidance… We may wish for better favor in our direction… We may see patterns in our lives that make it seem impossible to forgive. Steadfast, if we go forward with faith, we can find a way. . I know we can and will see miracles as we come to know and try to be like God. The Children of Israel show us weakness and strength.

Ponder how to establish a loving relationship with God. What comes when we establish a relationship with God? How do we remember the Lord throughout our lives? .

Their topics began with our understanding of God. A lot of their talk is supplemented by early Christian thinkers. These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted my re-understanding and my relationship with God … Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. … my interpretation, the First Estate Additional notes: God character, perfection, and attributes according to Origen, more generous than we can imagine. Co-existent with God, The Creation. | . | Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/ c. 130 – c. 202 AD) “Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice.” … my interpretation, everyone will be taught of the role of Jesus Christ in our eternal plan. Additional notes: God is collaborative in other words we participate. Moses 7:29 Enoch ask how can God weep. God is weeping, while seeing his children suffer. This is a reformation of how we should view God, merciful and kind. Macrina The advance of the soul is through God’s love. Julian of Norwich And I was answered in my understanding: ‘It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.’ In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it. | . | Universalism, the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions … In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God … my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity. Edward Beecher,Satan is trying to destroy true nature of God and the Plan. | . | . | President Nelson Choices for Eternity First, know the truth about who you are. If Lord were to speak to you today… He would make sure you understand is your true identity. I am simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.” | Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you…. In short, They have offered you everything! God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you. | And third, know the truth related to your conversion. The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you. Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life. You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe. | . | For those that have experience with the Temple… What is the focus of the Temple in our relationship with God? Understanding our relationship with God? Understanding the nature of God? How do we learn to love the Lord through the temple? | History, Stories, and Miracles in Joshua and Judges . As I read these stories, I often want to know more about the archeology, history, and details that verify these events. Things like the Ark of the Covenant, the Levite Priests, the Bugles, and the “facts’ around them are fascinating to me. Usually, I think about Indiana Jones when I think of the Ark and this fantasy leads me to Wikipedia and its linked sources to explore and Journey into the past. Here are the stories that fascinate me… . Children of Israel Cross Jordan Joshua 3:13,15,17 | The Walls of Jericho Joshua 6:2-6, 6:20 | Ambush at Ai, Joshua 6:14-21 | Trumpets and Lights of Gideon versus the Midianites Judges 7:16,20-21 | Samson and Delilah, is this scripture/history? Judges 16 | *** Why did the children of Israel keep falling int idolatry aka People after Gideon I have heard it said that our children today have such a hard time, I have seen it and felt it personally. This goes to them “Lest we Forget” . As far as evidences of these stories, there are as many opportunities to believe or doubt, even the Children of Israel doubted. Here are some things that we should understand as we read these stories… . These books belong to the tradition of Jewish history and law, called Deuteronomic, they were first committed to writing about 550 BCE, during the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Ezra is contemporary with this time of this compilation. For reference, the time period of Joshua is closer to 1400 BCE. | The death of Moses is recorded in Deuteronomy 34, the death of Joshua is recorded in the book of Joshua 24. Many of the events we have today were created from either oral histories or fragments. | Scholars, Archeologists and others often differ in opinion on cities like Jericho and Ai and how their destructions reconcile with being at the time of Joshua. | Come Follow Me suggests finding gems. It describes these books as being referred to as “Historical” portions of the Old Testament. Thus, some of these stories can be gruesome, troubling, or just from a single perspective. Come Follow Me Source: Thoughts to Keep in Mind | Be aware that Joseph Smith and his work on the Bible. The big changes in Joshua are referring to the “True Attributes of God”. The Contribution of the JST to the Old Testament Historical Books The KJV reads, “For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly” (Joshua 11:20). The Prophet changed it to read, “For it was of the Lord to destroy them utterly because they hardened their hearts.” | . | The Story of Rahab . Joshua 2 Before the Israelites cross the Jordan, Joshua sends men to scout out the land. Arriving in Jericho, they decide to spend the night at the house of the harlot Rahab. When Jericho’s ruler tries to apprehend them, Rahab hides them and then helps them escape, thus saving their lives. In return, she and her household are spared the destruction of Jericho and Rahab and her family become part of the people Israel. . Rehab’s Purpose . Rahab’s Faith, Works . Rahab in the ancestry of Jesus . My interpretation of Rahab’s example… God saves, atones and loves those with a past. Brother Darcy provided amazing insight on his feelings into this atoning process. He understood that in his work in education within the prison he saw hunger, compared to his work in traditional work in education where he sees complacency and a focus on credit hours. Lives are often best changed with a reawakening, we don’t necessarily need to be a harlot or be in prison, but whatever prison we shackle upon ourself, we need to awaken unto God and use the quickening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. .",

Satan has been successful in diverting much of the Christian world’s attention from the one doctrine that can save us, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to the ancillary doctrines that have meaning only because they draw their sustenance from this redeeming event. Like a skilled magician, Satan’s every move is to divert our attention and dilute our focus from the primary object at hand, namely Christ’s atoning sacrifice, in hopes we will turn exclusively to doctrines of secondary and far lesser import” (page 15). | “In the pre-mortal council the Savior covenanted with the Father to perform the Atonement. . . Based on that pledge or covenant we had faith in him. Based on that covenant the Father could promise remission of sins prior to the atoning sacrifice because he “knew” his Son would not fail. The issue was not that he could not break his covenant, but rather, that he would not” (page 74). Abraham 3 read verse 24. 25, 27. | So what is the Atonement, and why was the Fall of Adam and Eve so significant, even vital? Eve Moses 5:9–12, Were it not for our transgression… We never should have had seed | Never should have known good and evil | The joy of our redemption | The eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient | | Elder Callister state the purposes of the Atonement … To restore all that was lost in physical and spiritual death | To provide the opportunity to repent and overcome spiritual death | To allow us the potential to become a god or goddess. | | . | “The Savior observed every spiritual law with undeviating exactness apparently because of his compliance with each one, he received power upon power until he acquired the attributes of God, even in premortal ties. Such progress was a natural consequence of his exacting compliance. His godhood thus seemed to result not from a creation of these laws, but rather from compliance with them” (page 301). Moroni 10:32:33 shares how we become holy and without spot, which is the covenatn of the Father through Christ. | It is infinite in the blessings it bestows. The blessings of the Atonement extend far beyond its well-known triumph over physical and spiritual death. Some of these blessings overlap; some complement and supplement each other; but in the aggregate the effect of this event so blesses our lives in a multiplicity of ways, both known and yet to be discovered, that it might appropriately be said to be infinite in its blessing nature” (page 60). Romans 8:35-39 in life or death nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. | “One does not speak lightly of the Atonement or casually express his appreciation. It is the most sacred and sublime event in eternity. It deserves our most intense thoughts, our most profound feelings, and our noblest deeds. One speaks of it in reverential tones; one contemplates it in awe; one learns of it in solemnity. This event stands alone, now and throughout eternity. . . . “I now add my testimony to the many who have preceded me that his sacrifice was indeed an infinite and eternal Atonement” (pages 334-335). Doctrine &amp; Convenants 19:15-19 I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. | . | Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness By Sharon Eubank . Christ heals wounds. When tragedies overtake us, when life hurts so much we can’t breathe, when we’ve taken a beating like the man on the road to Jericho and been left for dead, Jesus comes along and pours oil into our wounds, lifts us tenderly up, takes us to an inn, looks after us. To those of us in grief, He says, “I will … ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, … that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.” | Christ is rest. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said: “It is not intended that we run faster than we have strength. … But [in spite of] that, I know … many of you run [very,] very fast and that [the] energy and emotional supply sometimes registers close to empty.” When expectations overwhelm us, we can step back and ask Heavenly Father what to let go of. Part of our life experience is learning what not to do. But even so, sometimes life can be exhausting. Jesus assures us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Christ is willing to join with us in the yoke and pull in order to lighten our burdens. | The Lord knows how hard you are trying. You are making progress. Keep going. He sees all your hidden sacrifices and counts them to your good and the good of those you love. Your work is not in vain. You are not alone. His very name, Emmanuel, means “God with us.” He is surely with you. | Christ sees us in our tree. For various reasons, we don’t feel accepted or acceptable. The New Testament shows the great efforts Jesus made to reach out to all kinds of people: lepers, tax collectors, children, Galileans, harlots, women, Pharisees, sinners, Samaritans, widows, Roman soldiers, adulterers, the ritually unclean. In almost every story, He is reaching someone who wasn’t traditionally accepted in society. Luke 19 tells the story of the chief tax collector in Jericho named Zacchaeus. He climbed a tree in order to see Jesus walk by. Zacchaeus was employed by the Roman government and viewed as corrupt and a sinner. Jesus saw him up in the tree and called to him, saying, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.” And when Jesus saw the goodness of Zacchaeus’s heart and the things he did for others, He accepted his offering, saying, “This day is salvation come to this house, [for] he also is a son of Abraham.” | . | .",

Cook 5 highlights First Love God - Post WWII by George Albet Smith, “reminded the Saints of the Savior’s invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies”. What do we think today as Russia invades Ukraine? Elder Holland, there is a quote that says “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” | Second Seek the Fruits of the Spirit - “will pitch our tents toward the temple”. This was reference to Lot and Abraham actions after parting ways and dividing land. In adversity, how do we avoid resentment? avoid the false coping strategies? | Third Excercise Agency to Choose Righteousness - “agency is at the heart of personal growth and experience”. How do we act in challenge? “all that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ”. My heart mourns for post missionary service and those that feel like they can’t recover from failing in their agency. Or members, who ultimately get to the Temple and suffer because of post Temple covenant breaking. My Testimony, I have experienced problems in my personal agencency because of “unfair circumstances”. Things can be made right throught the atonement. | Fourth Build Zion in our Hearts and Homes - “religious observance can “unleash the power of families … to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith.” I believe the pandemic was an opportunity for the Church to follow the prophet on “home-centered, church-supported religous observance”. As I have returned to school and have sat in equity, avoiding microagressions, and all lives matter type of meetings … It is my opinion, that our tolerance and love needs to increase, but also are covenant observance needs to be able to withstand all. I believe we live in a time similar to when Abraham was looking for 50 great souls to unite with him in faith and with God. Ultimately he could only could worship as a family. | Fifth Follow the Current Admonitions of Our Prophet - “feel enduring peace and joy, even in turbulent times”. I find it intrguing that Elder Cook says “Current Admonitions”. In turbulant time we don’t want to be Lot’s wife, perhaps that could be looking back at old admonitions by old prophets. Also, we need to feel joy and look ahead. Thoughts? | . |",

The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD. According to genealogies many biblical purest say Adam is 6000-10000 years old. | 2 Peter 3:8 … one day is with the Lord as a thousand years … | Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days … And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time. … | D&amp;C 77:6 speaks of temporal existence … the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence… W. W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | . Revelation continues, Restoration continues . Everyone will always be left to grapple between Wisdom of the World versus Wisdom of God. But the Gospel and Faith enable us to obtain continuous and pertinent revelation, even enlightenment if we study and ask. There are four accounts of creation in our scriptures 3 accounts, plus the temple. Abraham account says … ““We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.” | Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.) | Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed. | Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fullness. | In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man … And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth … Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. | . | .",

By the power of the Father, Jesus rose again and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. . Child of God . I have a story. My story is that I came to earth; just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live. We all share an earthly experience. My excitement, to this story, is that I am a child of God. That my birth, entitled me to a divine spirit! I believe we all have that spirit and it directs us in every major decision and thought. In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine potential. Shortly after, my 19th year, two years were spent serving the people of England. There were many days walking down roads unknown and several opportunities to teach others something familiar, that “God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return”. I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of these restoring truths and observing others tuning into their divine spirit. Today, 40+ years later, I continue proclaim that same witnesses and that same spirit truth resides within each of us. . Continue in Faith . I have had 5 wonderful children. My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience. We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children. Tamara left this earth at age 42. My first 3 children and I survived, but suffered. In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior. I had a visit from Jesus in my dreams and he presented to me that my deceased wife Tamara had risen, as well as certain ancestors gone before. At that time, I needed the comfort of these tender and miraculous experiences. After two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life … I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and seeing someone familiar, Lora. Once again, love returned to my life, it came with a blended family, and my first biological son. As with Job in the Old Testament, in adversity “I know that my redeemer lives” and that “the latter end of my life has more than my beginning”. Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives, many divine connections, and always a continuing faith as child of God. .",
