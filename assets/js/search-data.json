Job 1:3… His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. . Job 1:6-12, according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat. Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships. After each hardship a messenger returns to say… “I only am escaped alone to tell thee”. | Job 1:14-19 the hardships start to happen. 1st hardship … The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | 2nd … The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them. | 3rd … The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword | 4th … Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. | . | Job 2,41 is a whole bunch of poetry, lamenting, and praising. The highlight for me is Job 19:25-26 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that che shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: | And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God | . | Job 42:10,12-13,16 the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. | So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. | He had also seven sons and three daughters. | After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. | . | . Job . The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary. The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering. Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses). .

Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends? | . Reading Poetry in the Old Testament . I think Old Testament books when you get to Job are hard to read. The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings. While reading we are thinking across boundaries ot time. Boundaries of perspectives.

Purim, however, isn’t the only thing that makes Adar special . Adar is the only month in the Jewish calendar that comes back for seconds. The Jewish leap year, or shanah me’uberet (literally “pregnant year” in Hebrew), occurs approximately once every three years. In order to assure that the lunar months of the Jewish year stay in sync with the solar calendar, an additional month of Adar is added. Purim is celebrated in the second Adar. .

The “Ancients” at the time of Moses | Those that lived at the meridian of time of shortly after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, inspired by Givens fireside in May | And, the modern Church revelations and very recent Prophet statements today | We have been counseled through Come Follow Me, to find the Gems in the Old Testament. . My reflections of the Ancients to today were completely unified as I look toward the spirit. In Deuteronomic period of history, we see so much crisis; today we see similar crisis. In the Deuteronomic period we see that with God we can prevail. Today, I see that the Children of Israel “like miracles” can be found in through our obedience to the modern Prophet. . Many of us believe, we can feel the closeness of the Savior as did Peter, Paul, and the Apostles after the Savior was resurrected. We have a Prophet, that has provided us the recent “Spiritual Momentum” guidance. In this guidance, by repentance and allowing forgiveness to enter our hearts we will receive joy! We may not see a completeness… We may wish for more guidance… We may wish for better favor in our direction… We may see patterns in our lives that make it seem impossible to forgive. Steadfast, if we go forward with faith, we can find a way. . I know we can and will see miracles as we come to know and try to be like God. The Children of Israel show us weakness and strength.

Their topics began with our understanding of God. A lot of their talk is supplemented by early Christian thinkers. These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted my re-understanding and my relationship with God … Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. … my interpretation, the First Estate Additional notes: God character, perfection, and attributes according to Origen, more generous than we can imagine. Co-existent with God, The Creation. | . | Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/ c. 130 – c. 202 AD) “Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice.” … my interpretation, everyone will be taught of the role of Jesus Christ in our eternal plan. Additional notes: God is collaborative in other words we participate. Moses 7:29 Enoch ask how can God weep. God is weeping, while seeing his children suffer. This is a reformation of how we should view God, merciful and kind. Macrina The advance of the soul is through God’s love. Julian of Norwich And I was answered in my understanding: ‘It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.’ In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it. | . | Universalism, the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions … In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God … my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity. Edward Beecher,Satan is trying to destroy true nature of God and the Plan. | . | . | President Nelson Choices for Eternity First, know the truth about who you are. If Lord were to speak to you today… He would make sure you understand is your true identity. I am simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.” | Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you…. In short, They have offered you everything! God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you. | And third, know the truth related to your conversion. The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you. Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life. You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe. | . | For those that have experience with the Temple… What is the focus of the Temple in our relationship with God? Understanding our relationship with God? Understanding the nature of God? How do we learn to love the Lord through the temple? | History, Stories, and Miracles in Joshua and Judges . As I read these stories, I often want to know more about the archeology, history, and details that verify these events. Things like the Ark of the Covenant, the Levite Priests, the Bugles, and the “facts’ around them are fascinating to me. Usually, I think about Indiana Jones when I think of the Ark and this fantasy leads me to Wikipedia and its linked sources to explore and Journey into the past. Here are the stories that fascinate me… . Children of Israel Cross Jordan Joshua 3:13,15,17 | The Walls of Jericho Joshua 6:2-6, 6:20 | Ambush at Ai, Joshua 6:14-21 | Trumpets and Lights of Gideon versus the Midianites Judges 7:16,20-21 | Samson and Delilah, is this scripture/history? Judges 16 | *** Why did the children of Israel keep falling int idolatry aka People after Gideon I have heard it said that our children today have such a hard time, I have seen it and felt it personally. This goes to them “Lest we Forget” . As far as evidences of these stories, there are as many opportunities to believe or doubt, even the Children of Israel doubted. Here are some things that we should understand as we read these stories… . These books belong to the tradition of Jewish history and law, called Deuteronomic, they were first committed to writing about 550 BCE, during the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Ezra is contemporary with this time of this compilation. For reference, the time period of Joshua is closer to 1400 BCE. | The death of Moses is recorded in Deuteronomy 34, the death of Joshua is recorded in the book of Joshua 24. Many of the events we have today were created from either oral histories or fragments. | Scholars, Archeologists and others often differ in opinion on cities like Jericho and Ai and how their destructions reconcile with being at the time of Joshua. | Come Follow Me suggests finding gems. It describes these books as being referred to as “Historical” portions of the Old Testament. Thus, some of these stories can be gruesome, troubling, or just from a single perspective. Come Follow Me Source: Thoughts to Keep in Mind | Be aware that Joseph Smith and his work on the Bible. The big changes in Joshua are referring to the “True Attributes of God”. The Contribution of the JST to the Old Testament Historical Books The KJV reads, “For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly” (Joshua 11:20). The Prophet changed it to read, “For it was of the Lord to destroy them utterly because they hardened their hearts.” | . | The Story of Rahab . Joshua 2 Before the Israelites cross the Jordan, Joshua sends men to scout out the land. Arriving in Jericho, they decide to spend the night at the house of the harlot Rahab. When Jericho’s ruler tries to apprehend them, Rahab hides them and then helps them escape, thus saving their lives. In return, she and her household are spared the destruction of Jericho and Rahab and her family become part of the people Israel. . Rehab’s Purpose . Rahab’s Faith, Works . Rahab in the ancestry of Jesus . My interpretation of Rahab’s example… God saves, atones and loves those with a past. Brother Darcy provided amazing insight on his feelings into this atoning process. He understood that in his work in education within the prison he saw hunger, compared to his work in traditional work in education where he sees complacency and a focus on credit hours. Lives are often best changed with a reawakening, we don’t necessarily need to be a harlot or be in prison, but whatever prison we shackle upon ourself, we need to awaken unto God and use the quickening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. .",

The issue was not that he could not break his covenant, but rather, that he would not” (page 74). Abraham 3 read verse 24. 25, 27. | So what is the Atonement, and why was the Fall of Adam and Eve so significant, even vital? Eve Moses 5:9–12, Were it not for our transgression… We never should have had seed | Never should have known good and evil | The joy of our redemption | The eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient | | Elder Callister state the purposes of the Atonement … To restore all that was lost in physical and spiritual death | To provide the opportunity to repent and overcome spiritual death | To allow us the potential to become a god or goddess. | | . | “The Savior observed every spiritual law with undeviating exactness apparently because of his compliance with each one, he received power upon power until he acquired the attributes of God, even in premortal ties. Such progress was a natural consequence of his exacting compliance. His godhood thus seemed to result not from a creation of these laws, but rather from compliance with them” (page 301). Moroni 10:32:33 shares how we become holy and without spot, which is the covenatn of the Father through Christ. | It is infinite in the blessings it bestows. The blessings of the Atonement extend far beyond its well-known triumph over physical and spiritual death. Some of these blessings overlap; some complement and supplement each other; but in the aggregate the effect of this event so blesses our lives in a multiplicity of ways, both known and yet to be discovered, that it might appropriately be said to be infinite in its blessing nature” (page 60). Romans 8:35-39 in life or death nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. | “One does not speak lightly of the Atonement or casually express his appreciation. It is the most sacred and sublime event in eternity. It deserves our most intense thoughts, our most profound feelings, and our noblest deeds. One speaks of it in reverential tones; one contemplates it in awe; one learns of it in solemnity. This event stands alone, now and throughout eternity. . . . “I now add my testimony to the many who have preceded me that his sacrifice was indeed an infinite and eternal Atonement” (pages 334-335). Doctrine &amp; Convenants 19:15-19 I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. | . | Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness By Sharon Eubank . Christ heals wounds. When tragedies overtake us, when life hurts so much we can’t breathe, when we’ve taken a beating like the man on the road to Jericho and been left for dead, Jesus comes along and pours oil into our wounds, lifts us tenderly up, takes us to an inn, looks after us. To those of us in grief, He says, “I will … ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, … that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.” | Christ is rest. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said: “It is not intended that we run faster than we have strength. … But [in spite of] that, I know … many of you run [very,] very fast and that [the] energy and emotional supply sometimes registers close to empty.” When expectations overwhelm us, we can step back and ask Heavenly Father what to let go of. Part of our life experience is learning what not to do. But even so, sometimes life can be exhausting. Jesus assures us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Christ is willing to join with us in the yoke and pull in order to lighten our burdens. | The Lord knows how hard you are trying. You are making progress. Keep going. He sees all your hidden sacrifices and counts them to your good and the good of those you love. Your work is not in vain. You are not alone. His very name, Emmanuel, means “God with us.” He is surely with you. | Christ sees us in our tree. For various reasons, we don’t feel accepted or acceptable. The New Testament shows the great efforts Jesus made to reach out to all kinds of people: lepers, tax collectors, children, Galileans, harlots, women, Pharisees, sinners, Samaritans, widows, Roman soldiers, adulterers, the ritually unclean. In almost every story, He is reaching someone who wasn’t traditionally accepted in society. Luke 19 tells the story of the chief tax collector in Jericho named Zacchaeus. He climbed a tree in order to see Jesus walk by. Zacchaeus was employed by the Roman government and viewed as corrupt and a sinner. Jesus saw him up in the tree and called to him, saying, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.” And when Jesus saw the goodness of Zacchaeus’s heart and the things he did for others, He accepted his offering, saying, “This day is salvation come to this house, [for] he also is a son of Abraham.” | . | .",

As I have returned to school and have sat in equity, avoiding microagressions, and all lives matter type of meetings … It is my opinion, that our tolerance and love needs to increase, but also are covenant observance needs to be able to withstand all.

The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD.

W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | .

In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return”.

My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience. We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children. Tamara left this earth at age 42. My first 3 children and I survived, but suffered. In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior. I had a visit from Jesus in my dreams and he presented to me that my deceased wife Tamara had risen, as well as certain ancestors gone before. At that time, I needed the comfort of these tender and miraculous experiences. After two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life … I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and seeing someone familiar, Lora. Once again, love returned to my life, it came with a blended family, and my first biological son. As with Job in the Old Testament, in adversity “I know that my redeemer lives” and that “the latter end of my life has more than my beginning”. Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives, many divine connections, and always a continuing faith as child of God. .",
