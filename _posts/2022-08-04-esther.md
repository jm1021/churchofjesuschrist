### Purim and Adar (www.chabad.org)
Purim 2023 begins Monday night, March 6 and continues through Tuesday, March 7 (extending through Wednesday in Jerusalem)

The festival of Purim commemorates the Divinely orchestrated salvation of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from Haman’s plot “to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in a single day.” It is celebrated with Megillah readings, gifts of food, charity, feasting, and merriment.

Adar is known as a month of celebration and happiness, the late-winter month of Adar contains the joyous holiday of Purim. Purim, however, isn’t the only thing that makes Adar special

Adar is the only month in the Jewish calendar that comes back for seconds. The Jewish leap year, or shanah me’uberet (literally “pregnant year” in Hebrew), occurs approximately once every three years. In order to assure that the lunar months of the Jewish year stay in sync with the solar calendar, an additional month of Adar is added. Purim is celebrated in the second Adar.

Adar I and II occur during February–March on the Gregorian calendar.  Purim is celebrated in Adar II.  Someone born in Adar during a non leap year would celebrate their birthday in Adar II during a leap year.

Adar (Hebrew: אֲדָר ʾAdār; from Akkadian adaru) is the sixth month of the civil year and the twelfth month of the religious year on the Hebrew calendar, roughly corresponding to the month of March in the Gregorian calendar. It is a month of 29 days.

The month's name, like all the others from the Hebrew calendar, was adopted during the Babylonian captivity.

Adar was the last month the Jewish people spent in Egypt before the Exodus. Adar’s joy is so great, in part, because it serves as the opening to an even greater rejoicing: the miracles of Passover.  Passover this year was April 5 to 13.

### How to Celebrate Purim (18doors.org)
- Eat [Hamantashen cookies](https://18doors.org/recipe/peanut-butter-mm-hamantaschen/).
- Dress up in costume.  It is called the Jewish Halloween.
- Dance to Purim music about the Purim story.
- Give Mishloach Manot to friends. Mishloach Manot are goody bags filled with food treats.
- Give to Charity or teach giving to less fortunate.
- Purim is all about making noise, especially when reading from the Megillah, The Book of Esther. “Boo!” whenever you say the name “Haman”, and to cheer “Hooray” whenever you say “Mordechai.”
