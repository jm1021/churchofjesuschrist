## Preexistence
> [Premortality](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/premortality?lang=eng) is an amazing study.  In relating with people of other faiths, Jeremiah is an awesome starting point on th topic of preexistence or foreordination.  [
- Biblical Translations of Jeremiah 1:5
    - KJV: [King James Version](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=5#p4)
    ```
    Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
    ``` 

    - NIV: New International Version
    ```
    “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
    ```

    - NLT: New Living Translation
    ```
    “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”
    ```

    - ESV: English Standard Version
    ```
    “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
    ```

## Lord gives us lots of opportunities
> "How do I keep from backsliding?"  Backsliding is mentioned over and over in Jeremiah 3.
- The Covenant Path has many on ramps.  We continue to repent.  If we are asking the question, we are on the right path.  Keep trending upward.
- Fill your life with positive events.  Hobbies, music, scriptures and do many thing which are wholesome.
- Keep coming back to the Sacrament.  Keep renewing that covenant.  
- In my life, often one little backslide has helped me know where true joy is in life.

> Jeremiah 3

```
14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:

15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
```

## Scriptures used to overcome Evil
> "How do the scriptures turn me away from evil?"  Jeremiah has a great story on the process of writing and rewriting scripture.
- The very act of trying to have God in your life will turn you away from evil.  Our disposition to do evil will go away.
- Or, the very act of looking to increase our own testimonies will bring the spirit.  We may see many turn away from the scriptures, but with the spirit increased as we read the scriptures we can prevail.
- Try to be in the spirit of the people of that day, enter into their zone.

> Jeremiah 36

```
2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken ...

3 ... I purpose to do unto them; that they may <mark>return every man from his evil way</mark>; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and aBaruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord’s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.

27 ¶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, <mark>all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not</mark>.

32 ¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the ascribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and <marl>there were added besides unto them many like words</mark>.

## Covenants -- Why the Old Testament
> Sometimes I think the Old Testament is weird.  But, a big thing I have received in this round of study is seeing sacrifice and covenants.  Our oldest scripture, unite very well with our modern revelation. Jeremiah speaks of covenants.  They shall be my people and I shall be their God.  [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=31-34#p31), [Jeremiah 32:37–42](Jeremiah 32:37–42)
- <mark>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: And I will give them one heart, and one way</mark>

> So "who are we?".   Here is a synopsis of 2 hours with us, plus some quotes from our prophets.

### Betsy Dam
> Spoke on agency and the cunning of the adversary.   She said that joy comes in and through Gospel of Jesus Christ.  <mark>She prayed for our ability to make great choices</mark>.

### Mark Cuthbert
> Sacrifice.  Adam and Eve were told to worship the Lord and sacrifice the first king of the flock.  Jesus, part man and part God personally experience all loss and foolishness.  Jesus did this as live of all mankind.  <mark>Bring are hearts into submission</mark>, love mankind, practice becoming celestial beings.  Reflect light and love of God.

### Priesthood Meeting
