## Part 1 Hosea and Joel

### Background

> Book of Hosea, also spelled Osee, the first of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, considered as one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. According to the superscription, Hosea began his prophetic activity during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC). His prophetic announcements indicate that he was active until near the fall (721 BC) of the northern kingdom of Israel, the scene of his entire ministry. The text is quite corrupt and contains difficult problems of interpretation. Yahweh’s compassion for Israel, however, is generally the dominant theme. Having “played the harlot” with Canaanite rites and practices, Israel will surely experience Yahweh’s wrath, but not forever. Yahweh will welcome Israel like a husband who takes back an unfaithful wife. [Britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/)

> Book of Joel, second of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets. The Jewish canon lumps all together as The Twelve and divides Joel into four chapters; Christian versions combine chapters 2 and 3.  The book relates nothing about Joel except his name and that of his father. An analysis of the text further indicates that Joel lived during the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 BC–AD 70), for his book reflects the liturgy then in use.

## Part 2 Amos and Obadiah

### Background

> Amos, the first Hebrew prophet to have a biblical book named for him. He accurately foretold the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (although he did not specify Assyria as the cause) and, as a prophet of doom, anticipated later Old Testament prophets.  The little that is known about Amos’ life has been gleaned from his book, which was, in all likelihood, partly or wholly compiled by other hands. A native of Tekoa (now a ruin), 12 miles (19 km) south of Jerusalem, Amos flourished during the reigns of King Uzziah (c. 783–742 BC) of Judah (the southern kingdom) and King Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC) of Israel. By occupation, he was a shepherd; whether he was merely that or a man of some means is not certain. He actually preached for only a short time.  [Britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/)

> Book of Obadiah, also spelled Abdias, the fourth of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, in the Jewish canon treated as one book, The Twelve. Obadiah, with only one chapter consisting of 21 verses, is the shortest of all Old Testament books and purports to be a record of “the vision of Obadiah.” Nothing is known of the prophet except for his name, which means “servant of Yahweh.”
In the book, Edom, a long-time enemy of Israel, is castigated for its refusal to help Israel repel foreigners who invaded and conquered Jerusalem. To many scholars this reference suggests a date of composition after the Babylonian conquest of 586 BC. Others, noting the anti-Edomite sentiments in II Kings 8:20–22, consider a date as early as the 9th century BC also probable.  [Britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/)
