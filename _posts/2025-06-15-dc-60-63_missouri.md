## NFTs: A Divine Parallel

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier recorded on a blockchain, certifying ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. Similarly, our lives are like an NFT—unique and irreplaceable. Perhaps the Book of Life can be likened to a spiritual blockchain, where divine authority records the authentic journey of our lives, helping us achieve eternal success according to our faith and choices.
