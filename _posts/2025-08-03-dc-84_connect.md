## 🔗 Doctrinal Connectivism Through the Ages 84:1-25

God’s learning framework has always operated through connection: between people, generations, and heaven.

| **Era / Node**               | **Type of Connection**                           | **Spiritual Focus**                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Adam to Abraham           | **Generational / Vertical**                      | Priesthood passed through lineage (D&C 84:6–17); covenants established to bless all nations.   |
| 2. Moses and Israel          | **Prophet to People / Generational**             | God teaches His law through Moses; invites all to enter His presence (D&C 84:23–25).           |
| 3. Christ and Apostles       | **Direct / Vertical + Horizontal**               | Christ connects heaven to earth, builds network of disciples to carry His gospel.  Matthew 4:19-20, Acts 1:22-26 |
| 4. Early Apostasy            | **Disconnected Network**                         | Loss of authority; revelation diminished but preserved by John the Revelator, The 3 Nephites, Divine Messengers.|
| 5. Restoration (Joseph Smith)| **Reconnection / Priesthood Restored**           | Priesthood keys restored (D&C 84:18–22); truths reconnected across dispensations.              |
| 6. Modern Ordinances         | **Vertical + Horizontal**                        | Men and women connected to God through ordinances; family sealed through temple covenants.     |
| 7. Ministering & Gathering   | **Horizontal / Global**                          | Saints bless each other and the world—spreading light through service, testimony, and teaching.|
| 8. Future Zion & Adam-ondi-Ahman | **All Connections Converge**               | Heaven and earth united; all righteous from all times connected through Christ in His holy order. *(D&C 116:1; Daniel 7:13–14)* |

## 📚 The Holy Order of God as a Divine Learning Framework

The Holy Order of God is not just a title—it’s a heavenly curriculum. Through it, God takes us from carnality to divinity, using ordinances, covenants, and spiritual growth stages.

| **Learning Phase**         | **Spiritual Milestone**                       | **Action**                                                    |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Learn / Understand      | Faith in Jesus Christ                         | We begin by believing and learning of Christ.                  |
| 2. Apply                   | Repentance & Baptism                          | Acting on our belief; turning and covenanting.                 |
| 3. Analyze & Reflect       | Gift of the Holy Ghost                        | We receive ongoing revelation and correction.                  |
| 4. Evaluate                | Abhorring Sin / Becoming Sanctified           | We grow in spiritual discernment and purity.                   |
| 5. Create                  | Being Without Spot / Becoming Heirs of God    | We co-create Zion, build His kingdom, and become like Him.     |

## 📚 Priesthood as a Divine Learning Framework (D&C 84:18–46)

The priesthood is not just authority—it is God’s framework for spiritual learning, growth, and transformation.

| **Bloom’s Stage**       | **D&C 84 Reference**                                | **Spiritual Focus**                                                                                  | **Priesthood Focus**           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🔹 1. Learn / Remember   | v. 18 – “administereth the gospel”                  | Instruction and gospel teaching—learning truth from authorized channels.                               | **Aaronic** – learning and preparation |
| 🔹 2. Understand         | v. 19 – “key of the mysteries... knowledge of God”  | Not just facts, but understanding divine mysteries through covenant access.                            | **Melchizedek** – deeper understanding |
| 🔹 3. Apply              | vv. 20–22 – “ordinances... power of godliness”      | Participating in ordinances, receiving power—faith in action.                                          | Both – applied through ordinances     |
| 🔹 4. Analyze            | vv. 23–25 – “Moses... but they hardened their hearts” | Israel failed to discern and act—shows importance of examining our receptiveness to truth.            | Missed opportunity – rejecting analysis |
| 🔹 5. Evaluate           | vv. 33–35 – “receiveth my servants... me”           | Discerning true authority, choosing alignment with God—critical evaluation of spiritual influence.     | Priesthood as discerned authority     |
| 🔹 6. Create             | vv. 35, 42 – “receiveth my Father... cleansed from sin” | Co-creating with God—transformation into heirs and builders of His kingdom.                            | Priesthood enables sanctified creation |

## 🔗 The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood & the Five Temple Covenants

This eternal promise is received through covenant. The five temple covenants prepare us to receive all that the Father has.
> **D&C 84:38**  “And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.”

| **Temple Covenant**       | **Spiritual Promise**                                                             | **Scriptural Reference**                               |

## D&C 84:2 & Connectivism: A Divine Learning Network

### 🔗 What is Connectivism?

✅ Connectivism was formally defined in 2004 by George Siemens.
Connectivism is a learning theory for the digital age. It became especially relevant with the rise of the Internet—and even more so with AI assistance. It sees learning as a networked process, where understanding comes from connecting with reliable sources, systems, and people—not just memorizing facts.

- 🕸️ Spiritual Connectivism in Doctrine & Covenants 84
- ✨ The Lord was outlining a divine model of "spiritual connectivism" long before the digital age.

In D&C 84, given nearly 150 years ago, the Lord outlines a spiritual framework that parallels modern connectivist thinking.

“The Lord says He is forming a church for the purpose of connecting us to Him and spreading His knowledge to others.”

### 🧠 Learning as a Networked Process

“The priesthood is described as a line of authority and power that connects individuals to God—spiritual bandwidth, if you will.”

The Priesthood as Divine Network:

- Lesser Priesthood → "holds the key of the ministering of angels and of the preparatory gospel" (vv. 33–44)
- Greater Priesthood → "holds the key of the knowledge of God" (vv. 26–32)

This is more than structure—it's a relational network designed to connect us to Heaven and one another.

### 📍 Knowing Where to Find Information

Connectivism teaches that knowing where to find information is often more important than rote memorization.

The Lord reinforces this with His instructions to missionaries:

- D&C 84:61 – “Remain steadfast… in solemnity and the spirit of prayer…”
- D&C 84:85 – “Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life… it shall be given you in the very hour…”

This is a dynamic, Spirit-led access to knowledge—tailored in real-time, not rehearsed in advance.

### ⚡ Decision-Making as Learning

Connectivism views decision-making as a learning act—especially in rapidly changing environments.

Likewise, the Lord in D&C 84:

- Establishes structures (Church, priesthood, scriptures, Holy Ghost)
- Encourages responsiveness, not rigidity
- Emphasizes revelation through connection, not just retention

“The Lord puts in place systems not for memorization, but for connection and transformation.”

## 84:6 - Connection gains power as a generational relationship

### 🔗 Generational Power in Connection (D&C 84:6 + Hebrews 11)

#### 📖 D&C 84:6

“And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the hand of his father-in-law Jethro…”
This begins **a long genealogical chain—a sacred priesthood network**—linking Moses back through Abraham, Melchizedek, and ultimately to Adam.The point is not just lineage—it's spiritual transmission of power across generations.

#### ✨ Generational Nodes

“Connection gains power as a generational relationship.”
Yes. Just as connectivism says learning is enhanced through a web of connected nodes, the Lord teaches that **spiritual power is amplified through generational covenantal continuity**.

#### 📖 Hebrews 11:40

“God having provided some better thing for us, that **they without us should not be made perfect**.”
This powerful verse affirms **interdependence between generations**—that the faithful of old and the disciples of today are spiritually co-dependent for perfection.It mirrors the same theme: no isolated learning, no isolated salvation.

### Doctrinal Connectivism: A Summary

The priesthood lineage in D&C 84 shows how **power is passed, sustained, and strengthened through connection**.

- Hebrews 11 teaches that salvation is not individual but relational across generations.
- Modern connectivism teaches that isolated learning is weak; true growth comes through networked relationships.
- Therefore, spiritual learning and progression require deep, generational connection—to God, to ancestors, to the living, and to future generations.
- The Church, with the restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods and the establishment of temple covenants, connects the spiritual nodes in the chain—all the way back to Adam, which will be revealed in fullness at Adam-ondi-Ahman someday.

## D&C 84-14 - The Abrahamic covenant

The covenant which was revealed in the Pearl of Great price speaks to posterity and **the promises we receive through Abraham**.

### 🌍 The Abrahamic Covenant: Vertical & Horizontal Connections

#### 🔗 Vertical: Connection Through Generations

The Abrahamic Covenant is revealed in Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 2:9–11:

“And I will make of thee a great nation… in thy seed after thee… and in thy priesthood… shall all the families of the earth be blessed…”
Posterity — You shall have countless descendants (see also Genesis 22:17: “as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore”).
Priesthood and Blessings — These blessings are passed generationally, culminating in temple covenants and the gospel of Jesus Christ.

This lineage connects back to Adam and forward to us through restored priesthood authority (D&C 84:6–17).

#### 🌐 Horizontal: Connection Across Peoples

Abraham 2:11:“I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee (that is, in thy Priesthood) and in thy seed… shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”

This isn't just about descendants by blood—it’s about spiritual adoption and inclusion:

- Jews trace their heritage to Abraham through Isaac.
- Muslims trace theirs through Ishmael.
- Christians are adopted into the covenant through Christ (Galatians 3:29: “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise”).

![Connections of Faiths]({{site.baseurl}}/images/connections_of_faiths.png)

### 🧠 Connectivist Insight

As descendants of the Abrahamic covenant, **whether by blood or adoption, we are part of a vast spiritual learning and covenant network—stretching back to Adam and across the globe**.
We are “as the sand of the sea” (Genesis 22:17)—an image of both number and interconnectedness.
Our responsibility is not just personal salvation but to **bless all families of the earth—a fundamentally networked mission**.

### 🧬 The Covenant Network

This means:

- We don’t learn or grow in isolation.
- Our covenants connect us to the past, to one another, and to the future Zion.
- As learners, we are nodes in God’s divine educational network—bound by faith, priesthood, and love

## D&C 84:17 - Continueth

This verse is not just about lineage—it is about divine continuity, a sacred network that transcends time, culture, and mortality. Throughout history, the Lord has raised up nodes in His spiritual network—prophets, apostles, and disciples who receive and transmit light.

### 🔗 Historical Nodes in the Covenant Network

- Moses — Called back to his Jewish identity by revelation through the burning bush, restored to priesthood authority to lead Israel out of bondage (Exodus 3).
- David — A humble shepherd, chosen by the Lord and anointed by Samuel, empowered by the Spirit to defeat Goliath and become king (1 Samuel 16–17).
Saul → Paul — A persecutor transformed on the road to Damascus by vision and divine commission to carry the gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 9).
- Joseph Smith & Oliver Cowdery — Visited by resurrected beings: John the Baptist (Aaronic Priesthood) and Peter, James, and John (Melchizedek Priesthood), reconnecting the divine authority that had been lost (D&C 13; D&C 27:12–13).
- John the Revelator and the Three Nephites — Preserved by the Lord, not to taste death, but to remain as living links—eternal witnesses in the priesthood chain (John 21:20–23; 3 Nephi 28).

### Spiritual Connectivism Endures

In every dispensation, the Lord preserves and activates covenant connections, often through unexpected or humble servants. This divine network:

- Does not break with apostasy—it waits, then resurges through restoration.
- Does not rely on the perfection of its participants, but on the consistency of God.
- Shows that revelation is ongoing, and that we—like them—are invited to be part of the chain.
- **In spite of people, times, or seasons, the Church of God and its spiritual connections will persist.**

## D&C 84:18,19 Learn, Understand the Holy Order of God

### Holiest Order (Aaronic)

“The Holy Order of God is not only a line of authority—it is a divine learning and transformation framework. It begins with remembering, understanding, and ends with godhood, guiding us to understand, apply, analyze, and ultimately co-create with God. Through the priesthood, we don’t just learn—we become.”

### Mysteries and Knowledge of God (Melchizedek)

1. Remember  – "this greater priesthood administereth the gospel..."The priesthood is given for instruction and gospel teaching.
2. Understand "this greater priesthood... holdeth the key of the mysteries..."Not just facts, but the mysteries of the kingdom—a deeper understanding revealed through covenant and priesthood access.

### Enter into Rest Alma 13

“Entering into His rest” is not about stepping away from effort, but about stepping into alignment with God—so deeply and fully that we dwell in His presence, enjoy His peace, and trust His will, no matter what we face. It is the reward of a sanctified life, made possible by Christ and accessed through priesthood ordinances and enduring faith.”

✨ Modern Teaching (Elder Bednar)
“To enter into the rest of the Lord means to enter into the fullness of His glory.”
— Elder David A. Bednar, “Therefore They Hushed Their Fears,” April 2015

### All power is given to Jesus Christ 84:27,28

Apply power using repentance, baptism for the remission of Sins
John the Baptist prepared for the coming of the Lord
All power is given to the Lord

## Santification comes from magnifying the priesthood 84:33-34

Two Priesthoods
Elect of God

### Obtaining the Priestood

While priesthood offices are held by men,

- The ordinances and their power (baptism, sacrament, temple endowment, sealing, gift of the Holy Ghost) are offered equally to all.
- Women participate deeply in priesthood power—especially in temple covenants and through spiritual gifts and leadership roles.

### Quotes about Women

“How I yearn for you to understand that the restoration of the priesthood is just as relevant to you as a woman as it is to any man. Because the Melchizedek Priesthood has been restored, both covenant-keeping women and men have access to all the spiritual blessings of the Church.”
— President Russell M. Nelson, “Spiritual Treasures,” October 2019

“When a man and a woman are sealed in the temple, they are given the blessings of both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods. They enter into the order of the priesthood... This means they receive priesthood power and authority together to act in God’s name in their family and in His temple.”
— Elder Dale G. Renlund, “The Power of Godliness,” October 2021

“We are not accustomed to speaking of women having the authority of the priesthood in their Church callings, but what other authority can it be? When a woman—young or old—is set apart to preach the gospel, she is given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function.”
— President Dallin H. Oaks, “The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood,” April 2014
