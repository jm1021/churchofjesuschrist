## D&C 84:2 & Connectivism: A Divine Learning Network

### 🔗 What is Connectivism?

✅ Connectivism was formally defined in 2004 by George Siemens.
Connectivism is a learning theory for the digital age. It became especially relevant with the rise of the Internet—and even more so with AI assistance. It sees learning as a networked process, where understanding comes from connecting with reliable sources, systems, and people—not just memorizing facts.

- 🕸️ Spiritual Connectivism in Doctrine & Covenants 84
- ✨ The Lord was outlining a divine model of "spiritual connectivism" long before the digital age.

In D&C 84, given nearly 150 years ago, the Lord outlines a spiritual framework that parallels modern connectivist thinking.

“The Lord says He is forming a church for the purpose of connecting us to Him and spreading His knowledge to others.”

### 🧠 Learning as a Networked Process

“The priesthood is described as a line of authority and power that connects individuals to God—spiritual bandwidth, if you will.”

The Priesthood as Divine Network:

- Lesser Priesthood → "holds the key of the ministering of angels and of the preparatory gospel" (vv. 33–44)
- Greater Priesthood → "holds the key of the knowledge of God" (vv. 26–32)

This is more than structure—it's a relational network designed to connect us to Heaven and one another.

### 📍 Knowing Where to Find Information

Connectivism teaches that knowing where to find information is often more important than rote memorization.

The Lord reinforces this with His instructions to missionaries:

- D&C 84:61 – “Remain steadfast… in solemnity and the spirit of prayer…”
- D&C 84:85 – “Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life… it shall be given you in the very hour…”

This is a dynamic, Spirit-led access to knowledge—tailored in real-time, not rehearsed in advance.

### ⚡ Decision-Making as Learning

Connectivism views decision-making as a learning act—especially in rapidly changing environments.

Likewise, the Lord in D&C 84:

- Establishes structures (Church, priesthood, scriptures, Holy Ghost)
- Encourages responsiveness, not rigidity
- Emphasizes revelation through connection, not just retention

“The Lord puts in place systems not for memorization, but for connection and transformation.”

## 84:6 - Connection gains power as a generational relationship

### 🔗 Generational Power in Connection (D&C 84:6 + Hebrews 11)

#### 📖 D&C 84:6

“And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the hand of his father-in-law Jethro…”
This begins **a long genealogical chain—a sacred priesthood network**—linking Moses back through Abraham, Melchizedek, and ultimately to Adam.The point is not just lineage—it's spiritual transmission of power across generations.

#### ✨ Generational Nodes

“Connection gains power as a generational relationship.”
Yes. Just as connectivism says learning is enhanced through a web of connected nodes, the Lord teaches that **spiritual power is amplified through generational covenantal continuity**.

#### 📖 Hebrews 11:40

“God having provided some better thing for us, that **they without us should not be made perfect**.”
This powerful verse affirms **interdependence between generations**—that the faithful of old and the disciples of today are spiritually co-dependent for perfection.It mirrors the same theme: no isolated learning, no isolated salvation.

### Doctrinal Connectivism: A Summary

The priesthood lineage in D&C 84 shows how **power is passed, sustained, and strengthened through connection**.

- Hebrews 11 teaches that salvation is not individual but relational across generations.
- Modern connectivism teaches that isolated learning is weak; true growth comes through networked relationships.
- Therefore, spiritual learning and progression require deep, generational connection—to God, to ancestors, to the living, and to future generations.
- The Church, with the restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods and the establishment of temple covenants, connects the spiritual nodes in the chain—all the way back to Adam, which will be revealed in fullness at Adam-ondi-Ahman someday.
