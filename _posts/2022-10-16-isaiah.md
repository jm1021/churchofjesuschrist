### Gentiles
> The Gentiles are mentioned frequently.  This makes me wonder about... <mark>why was it difficult for some of the original apostles when Paul branched out on his Sermons to Gentile lands?</mark>.  Most of us are Gentiles!!!

> Isiah prophesied of the Gentiles.  The Hebrew term </mark>goyim translated as “nations” in this passage can mean people in general but is more often translated as “Gentiles” in Isaiah</mark> for example, see ...
- [Isaiah 11:10(https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11?lang=eng&id=10#p9); 
- [42:1,6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/42?lang=eng&id=1,6);
- [49:6, 22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=6,22#p5);
- [54:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/54?lang=eng&id=3#p1); 
- [60:3, 5, 11, 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/60?lang=eng&id=3,5,11,16#p2). 

> Latter-day Saints find a fulfillment of the prophecy that <mark>Gentile nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord</mark> as they witness individuals and families from nations around the world enter temples to worship and receive temple ordinances. 
- It probably would not have occurred to Isaiah’s contemporaries that this prophecy spoke of Gentile nations actually building, entering, and ministering in the temple.

### Temples
> Let's think of counsel from the Prophet and Apostles from Conference in reference to Isaiah 56.

[Isaiah 56:1-2, 7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/56.1-2,7-8?lang=eng#p1)

> Chapter 56 of Isaiah seems to offer some clarification on the issue of <mark>Gentiles and Temple worship</mark> and perhaps offer some indication that someday that Gentiles could actually enter in the temple. 
- After admonishing the covenant people to <mark>“Keep ye judgment, and do justice:</mark> for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed” (56:1)
- The Lord pronounces <mark>a blessing on those who follow his commandments, keep the Sabbath, and avoid doing evil</mark> (see 56:2).

> Saturday night session my Neil L Anderson
- Immerse ourselves more in Jesus.
- Our covenant keeping leads us closer and closer to him.  
- Holy Ghost requires us safeguard ourselves from sin and protect this gift.  <mark>The Gift of the constant influence of the Holy Ghost</mark> 

> Isaiah.Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar;
- <mark>for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people </mark> (see 56:7). 
- The Lord God which gathereth the <mark>outcasts of Israel</mark> saith, Yet will <mark>I gather others</mark> to him, beside those that are gathered unto him (see 56:8).

> Our Prophet opened the morning sessions stating
- <mark>Godly power comes into the world with each new temple</mark>.
