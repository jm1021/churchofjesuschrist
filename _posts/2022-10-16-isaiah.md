## Isiah and Prophesy
> The Savior seems to be the center of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (BOM).
- Great are the Words of Isaiah: [3 Nephi 23 1-3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/23?lang=eng&id=1-3#p1)
- The Prophet Russel M Nelson loves the words of Isiah, make the Sabbath a Delight: [Isiah 58 13-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=13-14#p12)
- Our Children need to learn of Isiah, he talks of the Savior, there are prophesies of today [Isiah talks of Savior: Friend](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/1998/03/isaiah-prophesies-of-the-savior?lang=eng)

### Gentiles are Part of the Plan
> The Gentiles are mentioned frequently.  This makes me wonder about... <mark>why was it difficult for some of the original apostles when Paul branched out on his Sermons to Gentile lands?</mark>.  Most of us are Gentiles!!!

> Isiah prophesied of the Gentiles.  The Hebrew term </mark>goyim translated as “nations” in this passage can mean people in general but is more often translated as “Gentiles” in Isaiah</mark> for example, see ...
- [Isaiah 11:10(https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11?lang=eng&id=10#p9); 
- [42:1,6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/42?lang=eng&id=1,6);
- [49:6, 22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=6,22#p5);
- [54:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/54?lang=eng&id=3#p1); 
- [60:3, 5, 11, 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/60?lang=eng&id=3,5,11,16#p2). 

> Latter-day Saints find a fulfillment of the prophecy that <mark>Gentile nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord</mark> as they witness individuals and families from nations around the world enter temples to worship and receive temple ordinances. 
- It probably would not have occurred to Isaiah’s contemporaries that this prophecy spoke of Gentile nations actually building, entering, and ministering in the temple.

### Temples and Gentiles are part of the Prophesy
> Let's think of counsel from the Prophet and Apostles from Conference in reference to Isaiah 56.  Study talks by scholars: [Temples and Isiah](https://rsc.byu.edu/eye-faith/isaiah-latter-day-temple)


[Isaiah 56:1-2, 7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/56.1-2,7-8?lang=eng#p1)

> Chapter 56 of Isaiah seems to offer some clarification on the issue of <mark>Gentiles and Temple worship</mark> and perhaps offer some indication that someday that Gentiles could actually enter in the temple. 
- After admonishing the covenant people to <mark>“Keep ye judgment, and do justice:</mark> for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed” (56:1)
- The Lord pronounces <mark>a blessing on those who follow his commandments, keep the Sabbath, and avoid doing evil</mark> (see 56:2).

> Saturday night session my Neil L Anderson
- <mark>Immerse ourselves more in Jesus.</mark>
- Our covenant keeping leads us closer and closer to him.  
- Holy Ghost requires us safeguard ourselves from sin and protect this gift.  <mark>The Gift of the constant influence of the Holy Ghost</mark> 

> Isaiah.Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar;
- <mark>for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people </mark> (see 56:7). 
- The Lord God which gathereth the <mark>outcasts of Israel</mark> saith, Yet will <mark>I gather others</mark> to him, beside those that are gathered unto him (see 56:8).

> Our Prophet opened the morning sessions stating
- <mark>Godly power comes into the world with each new temple</mark>


### Find a Reference in Isaiah
> Look at these talks, find something in Isaiah that inspires you to recognize the voice of the prophets.   These are my notes from the talks as I listened.
- For instance ,,, <mark>"Isaiah, Covenants"</mark>
- Find instance ... <mark>"Isaiah, Wedding Garments"</mark>

#### Russel M Nelson : <mark>"Isaiah, Covenants"</mark>
> We are constantly on the Prophets mind.  He weeps over our heartaches.  HF and JC are intermittently aware of our needs.  He testifies of their love.
- Curl up in PJs, but so many things are ahead.
- We will see manifestation of the Saviors power on faithful lives.
- Many feel overwhelmed or exhausted. Some leave Church because it requires too much.
- Open House committee insight on Washington DC temple.  Temple journey symbolism.  Boy pointed to alter as a place of rest on <mark>temple journey</mark>.  Covenant in Temple, Come upon me all you labour, I will give you rest...
- <mark>Heavenly Power is reward for keeping covenants</mark>.  This power leads our way.  Special rest.
- Savior has overcome the world.  Savior wills that we will overcome the world.
- Savior redeemed us from weakness, sin.  Including arrogance, pride, anger, jealously fear.
- 1st What is overcoming the world?  Give away are favorite sins.  Overcoming the world means grow to love HF and JC.
- 2nd How do we do it?  Yield to the enticing of the HG.  Becometh a Saint.  Living gospel produces Spiritual Momentum.  Do the spiritual work, JC will lift us the pull.
- 3rd How does it bless our lives.  <mark>Making covenants will come with opposition.  But, we have access to JC strength and redeeming power.</mark>
- Urge us to take charge of our testimony of JC.  Continually strengthen and watch for miracles.  Overcome the world through covenants.  This will lead to REST.
- Prepare a people to receive Jesus Christ.

### David A Bednar ; <mark>"Isaiah, Zion, Garment or Wedding Garment"</mark>
> New Testament is full of parables.  The intended meaning is not expressed directly.
- Parable of Royal Marriage Feast
    - Sons did not come, in spite of fatted calf
    - Jewish wedding were very important events
    - Not coming is an act of rebellion
    - Farm and Business priorities show lack of focus
    - Robes for guess provided, in order to make everyone equal
    - King gave guess close from his own wardrobe
    - And he was speechless, they did not robe in garment, disrespect for King and Son
    - For many are called, but few are chosen... all do not have on the wedding garment
- We can choose to be chosen, do not have hearts set on things of the world
- Zion must arise and put on her beautiful Garments

### Gerrit W Gong : <mark>"Isaiah, Repent and Forgive"</mark>
> Life happy ever after, then we grow up.  Happy and Forever are not fairy tales, but God's plan of  happiness.  As in Adam all die, even so in Christ ...  Joyfully abundant eternal life.  Infinite and Eternal.
- Joyfully learned Families could be together.  Friends had no desire to be Sealed to her Father.  Dream of Father and request to do other work for family.
- Researched diligently of a Gr. Grandfather.  Dream of a man needed to be found.  Gr. Grandfather was not who they thought.  A bent branch is not a bad tree.
- Atonement - unites spirit and body
- Atonement - fruits of repentance.  Divine ordinance enable sanctification through grace.
- God knows and loves us perfectly.  Encircles humble and penitent.
- Lord gives us divine opportunity to become like him.  Saviors on Mount Zion through Temple Work.  
- Golden rule.  Repentance and Forgiveness.  Offer to others what we need and desire.  Repent and Forgive.
