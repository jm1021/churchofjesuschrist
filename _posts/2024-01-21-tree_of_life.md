## Topic Reminders 1 Nephi 1-10

- I can gain and strengthen my testimony as I turn to the Lord.
  - 1 Nephi 2:16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, **I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father**; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.

- God will prepare a way for me to do His will.
  - 1 Nephi 3:7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, **for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them**.

- The word of God is “of great worth”.
  - 1 Nephi 4:13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. **It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief**.

- The plates identify Lehi as a descendant of Joseph.
  - 1 Nephi 5:14 And it came to pass that my father, **Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph**; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.

- We can forgive others.
  - 1 Nephi 7:20,21  “frankly forgive”. 20 And it came to pass that **they were sorrowful**, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.  21 And it came to pass that **I did frankly forgive them all that they had done**, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.

- God will reveal truth to me by the power of the Holy Ghost.
  - 1 Nephi 10:19 For **he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost**, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old **as in times to come**; wherefore, the course of **the Lord is one eternal round**.

## Tree of Life
Dreams can be Visions
- 1 Nephi 8:2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, **I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision**.

Any path to the Love of God can be accompanied by trial
- 8:5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood before me.

- 8:6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and **bade me follow him**.

- 8:7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that **I was in a dark and dreary waste**.

- 8:8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, **I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies**.

The Love of God
- 8:12 And as **I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul** with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.

The Word of God leads to the Love of God

- 8:24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and **they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron**; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, **clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree**.

Nephi's reflection includes "fell down"
- 30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, **until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree**.
