## Christmas 2022 Message fro Stake Presidency
> This Christmas season our hope and prayer is that each of us will feel the unconditional love of the Savior and recognize the precious eternal gift of His Atoning sacrifice.
> Our desire as a Stake Presidency is that every member of our congregations will ***feel the power and influence of communion with God***, that we may all know that we are His children and that we will personally feel His love. "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God” (Romans 8:16).
> We invite all to create an atmosphere and opportunity to allow the spirit to bear witness that we are His children. We encourage all members to individually or as family, ***before leaving home to attend Christmas Day Sacrament service, to kneel in humble prayer and plead with God that He might touch our hearts with the realization that He loves us and that our hearts may be open to hear and receive His spirit***.
> Like the petition in the well-known Christmas Hymn “Away in a Manger” we might prayerfully ask,
    - Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
    - Close by me forever and love me I pray.
> As you take these steps you will feel the Holy Spirit testifying of the divinity of Jesus Christ and will feel a closer connection to Him. You will give our Savior the gift that He seeks on Christmas Day – a closer relationship with Him.
> We love you! We wish each of you a wonderful Christmas season, and especially a spiritual and uplifting Christmas Day as each of us draw nearer to the babe born in Bethlehem.
