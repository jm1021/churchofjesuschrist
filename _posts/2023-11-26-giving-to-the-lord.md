## Thanksgiving Sunday

A time of thankful reflection. I am thankful for this moment to <b>discuss "Giving to the Lord"</b>

- <b>Praise be to the life of Jesus Christ</b>.  That we are able to glory in Thanksgiving through his grace
- I am thankful to God and Christ that I can be in <b>our SHARED Holy Place, our Ward and City</b>. 

In the news of Ukraine and Gaza, we are <b>SO blesssed to be living in a place of amazing weather, resources, and peace<b>.


### Giving to the Lord
<b>Feelings of respect</b>.  These are a few observed acts of service I observed from former weekly acquaintances. Observations that I miss from those that have passed, but <b>who cemented grand memories in me with their lives..</b>

- Kristan Kelly.  My memories service memories of Kristan, her glow and observing her service and companionship to Diane Harrington.  

- Jack Swain.  My memories of Jack are watching him gather on Spring Meadow Lane with David Tew on his way to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot.  Jack love to talk about this transformitive period in his life.

- Carl Moberly.   My memories of Carl were watching him hike from Poway road to his home after transporting to work on the bus.  I perceived this as a means to give to his family.

- Brad Wishoff.  Tamara had an aunt who was our same age.  He grew up in LA, like me and we did not have a single sports team we agreed upon Dodgers for me, Angels for him. Brad joined the Church against family traditions.


### Acts of Kindness
I came across an act of Kindness, a <b>card with many signatures</b> addressed to my son who was serving in Afganistan December 2011.  This was a card thanking Trent for his service.    It was signed by many in our ward today...

Randy Rose, Sam Ng, Carl Moberly, Tex Prows, Oddie Kelly, Dave Lang, Nathan Mahelona, Brian Hogstrom, David Nelson, Josiah Drew.

###  Sacrifice for each other
For any service there is a feeling thankfulness by another.  I want to share some of my thank you observation I see in <b>words, deeds, or actions from other Ward members</b>.

- Oddie Kelly.  There are many memories of gospel being shared in oue classrooms. Oddie is someone I have counted on for participation. Oddie and his comments always begin, "I am so gratfule to be among you ...".

- Brian Akagi.   I have always been amazed at the behind the scenes service I have seen from Brian in the media room, he has assisted in bringing the broadcast to those of us in need.  Brian's behind the scenes efforts don't end there...

- Heidi Drew.  The years of Music responsibility.  The music of Christmas and other holidays has been filled with music provided by Heidi for many years.  Her efforts stand out as a memory for me, particularly when I participate in choir.

- Gavin Raichart.  The years of Testimony meeting responsibility.  There have been many "man' size and heart felt testimonies from this "getting" older young person.

- Taelure Nelson.   I don't believe there has ever been and munch-and-mingle activity where I have not seen Taelure doing something productive and important behind the scenes.  Taelure is always doing something to serve us ..

- Terry Finch, Eddie Strause, Mark Edmonson.   The building the scenes of Halloween and Christmas.  There is a feeling of yesteryear and service reminisence in all the provide in props.

- Nathan and Devi Mahalona.  The great example of going and serving the Lord as missionaries.  They represent who I want to become ..


### Ward Caring 
By definition, <b>sacrifice is simply caring and turning our will toward God</b>.  The spirt most certainly bolsters any such event.

Sister Sigle.  A couple of weeks ago, "<b>our sacrifice</b>" became somewhat "<b>complete</b>" with regards to our long time ward member Claudia Sigle.  Our ward overwhelmed it on this Monday afternoon.  

Hector, Gary, Jared, Mark, Warren, Taelure, Claudia Hernandez, Lora and Tiernan, Gina, Heidi, Brian Wetzger, Lori Moberly, Cregg & Gabe Taylor, Brian & Karen Akagi, Randy & Cindy.  

I arrived on the scene and surely Taelure Nelson was there with Claudia Hernandez and of course Sister Hernandez smiling, greeting, smiling and saying, "your late".  There is always a humbling that comes with service.  But the event was full of joy.

## Church bolsters us "Light the World"
Our faith and desire to server is bolstered by community.    The Church and stake Mikkel ans Schafer send a lot of messages to help us remember Joy and to share Light.

- #1 Give your favorite book to someone.   I see a bond between my wife and her mother by sharing simple things.

...

- #50 Laugh with a friend.  On our Sigle move, it seemed that there was a lot of laughter.  Simplly watching people work together, sometimes awkwardly, brings a lot of joy.

<b>Light the world begins with a smile</b>.   Then the light of us all Jesus Christ seems to come through our simple actions.


### Seeking service
<b>Looking to the Church helps</b>.  Transitions in <b>life are a series of starts, continuations, and some ends<b>.  

<b>Serving God is love, love never ends</b>. 

Sometimes our balance changes.  The percentages of showing God's love change(+-), the key is <b>finding good balances</b>.  Trying to find God through faith in all phases of Church and Adult life.

- Seminary and High School (bolster your day)
- A truck driver 1 year (preparing to serve) ü•≤
- A missionary; 2 years  (90% serving God)  üëç
- A college student; 4 years (10% serving God)
- A tech guy; 36 years (10% serving God) üòÖ
- A husband; Tamara: 19 years, Lora: 17 years (focus on development and joy, 50% serving God) üëç
 - A father; Trent, Corey, Claire, Tiernan, Shay, 36 years üëè
 - A grandfather; Amelia, Cruz, and Gavi; 9 years üòá
- A teacher, working on my 5th year (focus on education, 50% serving God) ü´∂


### Forced acts of service
Sometimes burdens of life bring "forced" acts of service.  Watching Lori Moberly with Carl reminded me back to my time with Tamara.  In such a situation, you know the end is coming, you just don't know when.

In my case, the <b>Tender mercies of Heaven</b> accompanied my every step.  Small events of failure and realization become lasting memories.  

After Tamara died, <b>memories, geneology, and temple work interweave</b>.  Similar to Joseph and his experiences with Alvin.<b>  I had experiences of a parted veil</b>.

### Service comes with Risks
Justin Diczhazy was my friend.  I feel responsible to his Dad in all things.  Justin went to meetings, get aways, or to clinics whenever I asked.   But to some it is not enough.  

Don't think that service will always have a happy ending.

But I witness that God has touched me in all adveristies.   Justin died of overdose. My brothers died from AIDS. My son-in-law died from a self inflicted wound. 

<b>We may never know God's plan</b>. 

### Faith inspired acts of service
I believe <b>God opens doors and miracles to those who seek them</b>.  In my case, I looked an after coorporate life mircale...

- Served as a badged missionary and Wildwood Ranch
- Served as a one day a week Temple Worker
- Served in logistic operations worker at the Red Cross
- Served as a Math Teaching assistant at San Diego High School

I have beeen fortuante to have found an opportunity where I see my son Shay on a daily basis.   <b>Many things folded together to help me make Teaching a service choice</b>.


### Model Trains and Service
Best intentions sometimes mess up.   I was trying to "serve", but it did not work out the way I expected.   Sorry Roy, Tiernan, Shay and others.  Service should not be by my parameters.

I tried to give gas money to my daughter during Thanksgiving.  Sorry Claire, I will try to keep sickness to my own time.

Overall, God is love, family is love.  Ward family is love.   The service is were we can tend to make <b>things more difficult</b>.
