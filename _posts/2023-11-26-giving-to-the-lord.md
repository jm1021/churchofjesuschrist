## Thanksgiving Sunday

A time of thankful reflection.

- Praise be to the life of Jesus Christ.  That we are able to glory in Thanksgiving through his grace
- I am thankful to be in our Holy Place, our Ward and City. In the news of Ukraine and Gaza, we are SO blesssed to be living in a place of amazing weather, resources, and peace
- I am thankful for this moment to discuss "Giving to the Lord"


### Great memories from our Ward members in Heaven
Feelings of gratitde I have observed from former acquaintances with those who have passed.

- Kristan Kelly.    My memories service memories of Kristan, her glow and observing her service and companionship to Diane Harrington.  

- Jack Swain.  My memories of Jack are watching him gather on Spring Meadow Lane with David Tew on his way to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot.  Jack love to talk about this transformitive period in his life.

- Carl Moberly.   My memories of Carl were watching him hike from Poway road to his home after transporting to work on the bus.  I perceived this as a means to give to his family.


### Years Ago, Acts of Kindness
I came across a card with many signatures and addressed to my son who was serving in Afganistan.  This was a card thanking Trent for his service.    It was signed by many in our ward today...

Randy Rose, Sam Ng, Carl Moberly, Tex Prows, Oddie Kelly, Dave Lang, Nathan Mahelona, Brian Hogstrom, David Nelson, Josiah Drew.

### Great memories of Sacrifice together
Feeling of thankfulness that I see in words or deeds from others.  I see giving freely and a JOY in 

- Oddie Kelly.  There are many memories of gospel being shared by Oddie and his comment always begins, "I am so gratfule to be among you ...".

- Brian Akagi.   I have always been amazed at the behind the scenes service I have seen from Brian in the media room, or elsewhere.

- Taelure Nelson.   I don't believe there has ever been and activity where you have not seen Taelure doing something productive and important behind the scenes.

- Terry Finch, Eddie Strause, Mark Edmonson.   The years of building the scenes.  There is a feeling of yesteryear and service reminisence in all the provide in props.

- Gavin Raichart.  The years of Testimony responsibility.  There have been many "man' size testimonies from this "getting" older young person.

- Nathan and Devi Mahalona.  The great example of going and serving the Lord as missionaries.


### This month
By definition, sacrifice is  simply caring and turning our will toward God.  The spirt most certainly bolsters an such event.

Sister Sigle.  A couple of weeks ago, "our sacrifice" became somewhat "complete" with regards to our long time ward member Claudia Sigle.  Our ward overwhelmed it on this Monday afternoon.  

Hector, Gary, Jared, Mark, Warren, Taelure, Claudia Hernandez, Lora and Tiernan, Gina, Heidi, Brian Wetzger, Lori Moberly, Cregg & Gabe Taylor, Brian & Karen Akagi, Randy & Cindy.  

I arrived on the scene and surely Taelure Nelson was there with Claudia Hernandez and of course Sister Hernandez smiling, greeting, smiling and saying, "your late".  There is always a humbling that comes with service.  But the event was full of joy.
