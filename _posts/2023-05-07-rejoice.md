## Rejoice and give Glory to God
> Rejoice, today is the Sabbath.  It is a time for gratitude, to glorify God.  I am immensely grateful for the parables of Jesus at this time.
- [Luke 17:11-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17?lang=eng&id=11-19#p11) Where are the Nine?  Today we return to Jesus and give thanks. The Sabbath, Church, and the Sacrament.
- [DC 78:17-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.17-19?lang=eng#p17) Do you ever remember a time you may have been rushed and forgot to thank someone?   
- [Alma 34:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.38?lang=eng#p38) Is there anything that you do to remain gratefull? 
- Remember from Isaiah and President Nelson ... "call the sabbath a delight".  What makes the Sabbath a day to Rejoice?  How does this help us to become the one that returns and gives gratitude to the Lord?


### Can we Rejoice in the story of "the Woman caught in Adultry"?
> [John 8:1-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng) It seem to  profoundly impact John "And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.", refering to Jesus.
- This is my story of allowing only "family" to a "family reunion".  The rule is based on the Patriarch of the reunion who I believe is using "The Family Proclamation" as his guide.  My daughter has a girlfriend.
    - Rule... "Claire I went to bat for you regarding reunion and failed. They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus" 
    - Peacemaker statement... "Lora and I will pray for a change of heart"
    - Support of Reunion... "In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents."
    - Response... "I understand.  I was thinking…. Is there anyway you guys would be willing to pick me up on the way?"


### Have you Rejoiced in finding the One?
> [Luke 15:3-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=p3-p10#p3).  I have many stories: Keith Beaven (full time missionary), Lee Bazarone (basketball, missionary), Peter Nicholls (return to the mission field), Silvio Maggioto (missionry support), Joe Diczhazy (ministering).  On the Peter Nicholls story, I had two opportunities to spend time with him in England 30+ years after his baptism.  I was messaging him about 4 years ago as I titled caption with "I found you Peter!".

3 ¶ And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

8 ¶ Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?

9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

### Do you Rejoice as a brother of the "Prodigal Son"?
> [Luke 15:11-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=11-32#p11) As a parent, we often stick up for a child.  Can this create jealousy of another child?
- Story of my brother.  My family is one of different rules, my family grew up in LA and literaly lived a Hollywood lifestyle.  My mother had Director Boy Friend [Dick Dixon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228809/).  My brother, 6 years my Senior, was closest thing I had to a Dad.  He was a Gay man and later in life.  There were multiple returns of Jase.
    - Later in life he ended up being alone.  He stayed with my Mom and Step Dad (Giovannin) until my Mom passed.
    - At the end of his life, he was stranded in Central Valley as he, on his own permission, was driving to live out his days with me.
    - I was jealous of my brother many times in life.  Even toward the end, I was jealous about how he freely and boldly spoke about Jesus and how he glorified his purpose and mission.  This was as he left Marijuana in our backyard.
    - In this story, I may be the prodigal son?
