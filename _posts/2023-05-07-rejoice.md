## Rejoice and give Glory to God
> Rejoice, today is the Sabbath.  It is a time for gratitude, to glorify God.  I am immensely grateful for the parables of Jesus at this time.
- [Luke 17:11-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17?lang=eng&id=11-19#p11) Where are the Nine?  Today we return to Jesus and give thanks. The Sabbath, Church, and the Sacrament.
- [DC 78:17-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.17-19?lang=eng#p17) Do you ever remember a time you may have been rushed and forgot to thank someone?   
- [Alma 34:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.38?lang=eng#p38) Is there anything that you do to remain grateful? 
- Remember from Isaiah and President Nelson ... "call the sabbath a delight".  What makes the Sabbath a day to Rejoice?  How does the Sabbath help us to become the one that returns and gives gratitude to the Lord?


### Can we Rejoice in the story of "the Woman caught in Adultry"?
> [John 8:1-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng) It seems to have profoundly impacted John as he wrote "And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.", referring to Jesus.  As I read this story, writting on the ground impacted on me.  It helped me greatly with my own story, where I felt caught in the middle of two loved ones.
- This story is about allowing only "family" to an upcoming "family reunion".  This rule, I believe, is based off of our Patriarch for the reunion (pictured) likely using "The Family Proclamation" as his guide.  My daughter (also picture), who has a girlfriend,  wants to bring her to the reunion.
    - Regarding rule... "Claire I went to bat for you regarding reunion and failed. They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus" 
    - My attempt at a Peacemaker statement... "Lora and I will pray for a change of heart"
    - Support of Reunion and purpose... "In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents."
    - Clair's Response... "I understand.  I was thinking…. Is there anyway you guys would be willing to pick me up on the way?"
    - Summary... I was energized by this parable to take the proverbial time to "draw in the ground".  The reading of the parable and the family discussion were synchronous in timing in my life.  In this event, I was so proud of Claire's response.  It seemed Claire answered my prayers, while in my thought process I was focussed on my Father-in-Law from my deceased wife.  Though, we all know our family stories continue...  My prayers need to continue... Stay tuned for the post family reunion update.

### Have you Rejoiced in finding the One?
> [Luke 15:3-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=p3-p10#p3).  I have many stories: Keith and Sheila Beaven (full time missionary), Peter Nicholls (full time missionary and my return trips to the mission field), Lee Bazarone (basketball missionary experience), Silvio Maggioto (missionry support), Joe Diczhazy (ministering)...  

On the Peter Nicholls story, I had two opportunities to find him in England 30+ years after we lost contact.  We attended Kings Lynn Ward as I brought a non-member from work.  We attended Peterboro Ward where he and one of my contemporary missionaries served in leadership callings.  About 4 years ago I found an old picture of him, I sent him a picture with caption "I found you Peter!".  Though, on the totality of the experience, they found me.

3 ¶ And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

8 ¶ Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?

9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

### Do you Rejoice as a brother of the "Prodigal Son"?
> [Luke 15:11-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=11-32#p11) As a parent, we often stick up for a child.  Can this create jealousy of another child?
- Story of my brother.  My family is one of different rules, my family grew up in LA and literaly lived a Hollywood lifestyle.  My mother had Director Boy Friend [Dick Dixon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228809/) that was a significant figure in my childhood.  My brother, 6 years my Senior, was closest thing I had to a Dad.  My brother and I were exposed to a lot.  James (Jase), my brother, was a Gay man.  There were multiple returns of Jase into my life, a signifcant one was were he ended up staying with my mother and step dad Giovanni, until my Mother passed..
    - At the end of his life, Jase was stranded in Central Valley as he and his cat, on his own permission, were driving to live out his final days with me.  He often told others the the Mormons saved him in the desert.   Less than a year later, Jase died of AIDS. 
    - I was often jealous of my brother many times in life.  In his last year in San Diego, I was jealous about how he freely and boldly spoke about Jesus and how he glorified his purpose and mission.  
    - Of course, with this jealousy, came our critical perspectives of him as he would do things like leave "Marijuana Joints" in our backyard.
    - To take a line from President Nelson.  In this story, were you thinking that my brother was the prodigal son?  
    - I loved Jase and was proud to have him as my brother.  In the theory of doctrine, we might call him prodigal.  In theory of love and being loved, my brother was far superior.
    - To lead into the Father Abraham parable, I see Jase in his bosom.  If not, I see Jase speaking up for me in spite of an condemnations he may be facing.
