## Rejoice and give Glory to God
> Rejoice, today is the Sabbath.  It is a time for gratitude, to glorify God.  I am immensely grateful for the parables of Jesus at this time.
- [Luke 17:11-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17?lang=eng&id=11-19#p11) Where are the Nine?  Today we return to Jesus and give thanks. The Sabbath, Church, and the Sacrament.
- [DC 78:17-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.17-19?lang=eng#p17) Do you ever remember a time you may have been rushed and forgot to thank someone?   
- [Alma 34:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.38?lang=eng#p38) Is there anything that you do to remain gratefull? 
- Remember from Isaiah and President Nelson ... "call the sabbath a delight".  What makes the Sabbath a day to Rejoice?  How does this help us to become the one that returns and gives gratitude to the Lord?


### Can we Rejoice in the story of "the Woman caught in Adultry"?
> [John 8:1-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng) It seem to  profoundly impact John "And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.", refering to Jesus.
- This is my story of allowing only "family" to a "family reunion".  The rule is based on the Patriarch of the reunion who I believe is using "The Family Proclamation" as his guide.  My daughter has a girlfriend.
    - Rule... "Claire I went to bat for you regarding reunion and failed. They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus" 
    - Peacemaker statement... "Lora and I will pray for a change of heart"
    - Support of Reunion... "In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents."
    - Response... "I understand.  I was thinking…. Is there anyway you guys would be willing to pick me up on the way?"


### Do you Rejoice as a brother of a "Prodigal Son"?
> [Luke 15:11-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=11-32#p11) As a parent, we often stick up for our children.  Can this create jealousy?
- Story of my brother.  My family is one of different rules, my family grew up in LA and literaly lived a Hollywood lifestyle.  My mother had Director Boy Friend [Dick Dixon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228809/).  My brother, 6 years my Senior, was closest thing I had to a Dad.  He was a Gay man and later in life.  There were multiple returns of Jase.
    - Later in life he ended up being alone.  He stayed with my Mom and Step Dad (Giovannin) until my Mom passed.
    - At the end of his life, he was stranded in Central Valley as he, on his own permission, was driving to live out his days with me.
    - I was jealous of my brother many times in life.  Even toward the end, I was jealous about how he freely and boldly spoke about Jesus and how he glorified his purpose and mission.  This was as he left Marijuana in our backyard.
    - In this story, I may be the prodigal son?

### Many more parables
> Did any of these stories weigh on you mind or impact your lives over the last few weeks?

- The Good Shepherd [John 10:1-30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=1-30#p1) - he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice

- The foolish rich man [Luke 12:13–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/12?lang=eng&id=13-21#p13) - lay up treasures in heaven rather than on earth

- The great supper [Luke 14:12–24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/14?lang=eng&id=12-24#p12) - no one is showing up to the supper, they all have an excuses

- The unjust steward [Luke 16:1–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/16?lang=eng&id=1-12#p1) - a lesson in stewardship, "faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much"
