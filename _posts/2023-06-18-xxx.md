## Conversion is an ongoing process
When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  David Bednar, spoke of "the relationship between receiving a testimony that Jesus is the Christ and becoming converted to Him and His gospel".

[Mathew](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.15-17?lang=eng#p15)
“And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 16:15–17).

As is evidenced in Peter’s reply and the Savior’s instruction, a testimony is personal knowledge of spiritual truth obtained by revelation. A testimony is a gift from God and is available to all of His children. 

- Carl Moberly and the words of his brother and children really emphatically stated "strengthen thy brethern", or in his case his family.

- Today, my strength is giving tech to others.  However, I feel I pale in comparison to many of you who give and impart of the spirit.

### The Savior suffered for me in Gethsemane.
The olive garden is a beuty in the terrain of Israel.  Review the picture above.  Then read these few words that we have.  Only three living people knew of this event at the time.

41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
