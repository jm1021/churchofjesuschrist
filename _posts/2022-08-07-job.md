### Warm-Up activity is to recap the book Job
> Job is a life known for overcoming trials.
> [Job 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=3#p2)... His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
- [Job 1:6-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=6-12#p6), according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat.  Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships.  After each hardship a messenger returns to say... "I only am escaped alone to tell thee".
- [Job 1:14-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=14-19#p13) the hardships start to happen.
    - 1st hardship ... The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword.
    - 2nd ... The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them.
    - 3rd ... The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword
    - 4th ... Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead.
- Job 2,41 is a whole bunch of poetry, lamenting, and praising. The highlight for me is [Job 19:25-26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/19?lang=eng&id=25-26#p24)
    - For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that che shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
    - And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God
- [Job 42:10,12-13,16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/42?lang=eng&id=10,12-13,16#9) the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
    - And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
    - So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
    - He had also seven sons and three daughters.
    - After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.

### Job 
> The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary.  The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering.  Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses).
- [More on the Book of Job](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1982/03/job-the-man-and-his-message?lang=eng)
- Read the statement <mark>Yet Will I Trust in Him</mark> which is the lesson theme.  What does this theme me to you?
- Focus in on the image of <mark>Job talking to friends</mark>. Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends?


### Reading Poetry in the Old Testament
> I think Old Testament books when you get to Job are hard to read.  The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings.  While reading we are thinking across boundaries ot time.  Boundaries of perspectives.  Come Follow me has an inserted section stating..
    - Repetition of thoughts, parallelism, poetry
    - Hebrew language, different culture, different thoughts

> Tennyson has been quoted as stating that the book of Job is “the greatest poem of ancient or modern times.”  Of course, Tennyson was a poet...
```
And by the moon the reaper weary,
Piling sheaves in uplands airy,
Listening, whispers, "'Tis the fairy
      Lady of Shalott."
```

- [Job 14:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/14?lang=eng&id=14-15,16#13)
    - <mark>If a man die, shall he live again?</mark> all the days of my appointed time will I wait, <mark>till my change come</mark>.
    - Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to <mark>the work of thine hands</mark>.
- Doctrine in Covenants 29:43
    - <mark>And thus did I, the Lord God</mark>, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that <mark>by his natural death he might be raised</mark> in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe;
- Mosiah 16:8
    - But <mark>there is a resurrection</mark>, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.
    - <mark>He is the light</mark> and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.
    - Even <mark>this mortal shall put on immortality</mark>, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil—
    - If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation
