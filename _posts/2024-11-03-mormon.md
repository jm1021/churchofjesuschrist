#### Mormon 1:15

Scripture: "And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was **visited of the Lord**, and **tasted** and **knew of the goodness of Jesus**."

Reference: This verse shows the missionary efforts and the unity among the people.

Question: Do we see the **temples** as a latter-day blessing?  Or, do we have anything that compares our generation to that generation of the **church of Christ**?

## Key Authors in the Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon is a compilation of writings from various prophets and leaders who recorded their testimonies, teachings, and experiences. Each author brings a unique perspective and linguistic style, contributing to the richness and depth of the text.

Mormon goes to the hill of Shim and obtains the records according to the words of Ammoron.  This event changes everything in Mormon's life.  Mormon only had his **family and the scriptures** as guides to follow the teaching of Jesus.  

- **Scripture**: "And it came to pass that I did go forth according to the words of Ammaron, and take the plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron." (Mormon 1:3-4)

**Think of the joy Mormon must have felt as he explored, studied, and abridged the Nephite and Lamanite records**. As I reflect on Mormon's exploration, I think of my own explorations of the Book of Mormon and how **Mormon's heroic life brought us these stories and testimonies of Jesus Christ**.

### **Nephi** of 1st and 2nd Nephi

Nephi's writings in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi focus on his journey to the Promised Land and his **teachings about Jesus Christ**.

(Mosiah 3:5)
- **Years**: Mosiah's writings cover approximately 130-91 B.C.

### **Alma** the Younger

Alma's **missionary work** and his efforts to preach to the Lamanites are detailed in the Book of Alma.

And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments." (Helaman 10:4)

- **Scripture**: "And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of this people who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and these are the words which I speak: **Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel**. Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved." (Mormon 7:1-3)
- **Years**: Mormon's writings cover approximately A.D. 321-385.

### **Moroni**

- **Scripture**: "And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that **ye would ask God**, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost." (Moroni 10:4)

- **Scripture**: "And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: **That he lives!** For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father." (Doctrine and Covenants 76:22-23)
- **Years**: Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from 1827 to 1829.

### Mormon and Joseph Smith Parallels

**The Lord often entrusts significant responsibilities to young people**.  Called by visions and then demonstrating His confidence in their potential and faithfulness.

Their experiences remind us that **the Lord's work often requires courage and perseverance**, especially in the face of adversity. By following their examples, we can strengthen our own faith and contribute to the ongoing work of the Lord in our time.

#### Calling

Both Mormon and Joseph Smith were called to significant roles at a young age. **Mormon had a vision at 15 (Mormon 1:15) and was called to lead the Nephite armies at age 16 (Mormon 2:1-2)**. Similarly, Joseph Smith had his First Vision at 14 and was called to translate the Book of Mormon in his early 20s (Joseph Smith—History 1:7, 14, 33-34).

#### Standing Alone

Both faced opposition and had to stand firm in their faith. Mormon led the Nephites during a time of great wickedness, and Joseph Smith faced persecution for his role in restoring the gospel. **Both discovered the plates** and used the Nephite and Lamanite records to bolster their own faith. **They prepared the latter-day Book of Mormon** so that future generations could be benefactors of their work, providing **a second testimony of Jesus Christ**.

## 200 year of Happiness

### 4 Nephi 1:2-3

"And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, **and there were no contentions and disputations among them**, and every man did deal justly one with another. And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift."

Reference: This verse describes the **unity and peace among the people** following Jesus Christ's visit.

Question: What helps you to avoid **contention** and **disputations**?

### 4 Nephi 1:16

"And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there **could not be a happier people** among all the people who had been created by the hand of God."

Reference: This verse emphasizes **the happiness and righteousness of the people** during this period.

Question: What **makes you happier**?  What **causes you to stop** being happy?

## Mormon testimony of Jesus

### Mormon 3:20-21

"And these things do **the Spirit manifest unto me**; therefore I write unto you all. And for this cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they be good or evil; **And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ**, which ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him whom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was **the very Christ and the very God**."

Reference: This verse shows **Mormon's understanding of Jesus Christ's role** as the judge and Savior of all mankind.

Qustion: What has been **manifested** to you? **How do we believe** the gospel of Jesus Christ?

### Mormon 7:5

"Know ye that **ye must come unto repentance**, or ye cannot be saved. Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that God shall command you."

Reference: This verse emphasizes **the necessity of repentance** and following Jesus Christ's teachings.

Question: What does **daily repentance** look like in your life? Does this boil down to **choices**?
