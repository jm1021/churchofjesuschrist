## Spiritual Progression

An exploration on how faith, hope, charity, and love deepen as we progress spiritually. We’ll use four levels: terrestrial (basic), enlightenment (awakening), covenant (commitment), and sanctification (divine alignment).

### Scriptural Basis

**D&C 4:5–6:** “Faith, hope, charity, and love, with an eye single to the glory of God…”

These qualities are foundational for discipleship.

**Progression:** We don’t achieve perfect faith, hope, charity, or love all at once. Instead, God helps us grow step by step.

------

## Faith

A gift from God that enables individuals to trust in Him and His plan. It is the first principle of the gospel and is centered in Jesus Christ. Faith leads to action and obedience.

### Terrestrial:  Basic, Self-Reliant

**Definition**: Faith rooted in worldly systems or self-reliance, often fragile under pressure.

**Scripture**: **D&C 3:7** – Joseph feared man more than God in losing the 116 pages.

**Joseph’s Story**: Losing the manuscript showed how earthly concerns (e.g., pleasing Martin Harris) can undermine faith.

**Personal Application**: Share a story of when you (or someone relatable) trusted more in people or circumstances than in God.

### Enlightenment: Awakening

**Definition**: Faith grows as we experience God’s mercy and guidance, but we may still waver under life’s demands.

**Scripture**: **D&C 6:14** – Joseph learns that faith brings blessings and instruction.

**Joseph’s Story**: After repenting for the 116 pages, Joseph learned to trust God more deeply.

**Personal Application**: When have you turned back to God after realizing you couldn’t handle something on your own?

### Covenant: Commitment to God

**Definition**: Faith that aligns with covenants and discipleship, shaping our actions and priorities.

**Scripture**: **D&C 4:5** – Faith tied to “an eye single to the glory of God.”

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph’s unwavering dedication to translating the Book of Mormon reflects covenant-level faith.

**Personal Application**: How has keeping a covenant strengthened your faith?

### Sanctified: Perfect Trust

**Definition**: Faith that is pure and unwavering, fully aligned with God’s will.

**Scripture**: **D&C 6:36** – Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph showed sanctified faith in Zion’s Camp and his later leadership of the Church.

**Personal Application**: What would it look like to trust God completely in your life?

### Faith Class Activity

**Personal Reflection on Levels**: Write in notes the four levels mentioned. In groups of four, discuss each level and write or discuss experiences with faith at each level.

**Example**: “In what ways is your faith still tied to earthly things? Where have you felt covenant-level faith, trusting in God’s promise ask and you shall receive?”

Remember honesty in discussion, growth is a process. Please, (if comfortable), share insights about your current level and how you hope to progress.

### The Goal of Sanctification

**Scripture**: **D&C 11:12–14** - The Spirit leads us to do good, love God, and trust in divine promises.

“Sanctification isn’t perfection we achieve on our own; it’s a process of aligning our lives with Christ through faith.”

**Challenge**: Personal Application: “What small step could you take this week to grow in your faith?”

------

## Hope

The confident expectation of receiving promised blessings through Jesus Christ. Hope is an anchor to the soul, providing strength and assurance in God's plan.

### Terrestrial: Worldly Hope

**Scripture**: **D&C 5:7** – Martin Harris asks for a sign, representing hope tied to tangible evidence rather than spiritual assurance.

**Joseph’s Story**: Early on, Joseph and his companions often sought validation in worldly success (e.g., wanting converts quickly).

**Personal Reflection**: My hope is often tied to immediate results. I struggle to trust in God’s timing and cling to hopes based on outcomes I can control.

### Enlightenment: Growing Spiritual Hope

**Scripture**: **D&C 6:13** – “There is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.” Enlightened hope looks beyond immediate circumstances to eternal promises.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph learned to find hope in personal revelation and the guidance of the Spirit during the translation process.

**Personal Reflection**: I feel this kind of hope when I trust in God’s ability to make my weaknesses strengths, even if the process is slow.

### Covenant: Hope Tied to Divine Promises

**Scripture**: **D&C 11:23** – “Have good desires, and have thrust in your sickle to reap.” Covenant hope is grounded in eternal rewards promised through sacred covenants.

**Joseph’s Story**: Hope sustained Joseph as he led the Saints to Kirtland and beyond, trusting in the Lord’s promise of Zion.

**Personal Reflection**: Hope tied to covenants reminds me that my efforts have eternal significance, even when I feel inadequate.

### Sanctification: Perfect Hope

**Scripture**: **D&C 4:2** – “Serve him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength.” Perfect hope inspires total consecration.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph exemplified sanctified hope as he faced martyrdom, confident in the Lord’s ultimate triumph.

**Personal Reflection**: Perfect hope feels like trusting God so completely that I am at peace regardless of life’s storms—a place I’m striving to reach.

------

## Charity

The pure love of Christ, which never fails. It is the greatest of all virtues and includes selfless service, kindness, and compassion.

### Terrestrial: Self-Serving Charity

**Scripture**: **D&C 10:20** – Satan’s plan to destroy God’s work shows how earthly “charity” (self-interest disguised as good) can lead astray.

**Joseph’s Story**: Early on, misplaced trust in others, like Martin Harris, shows charity influenced by human weakness.

**Personal Reflection**: My service can sometimes be transactional—seeking recognition or validation.

### Enlightenment: Empathy and Compassion

**Scripture**: **D&C 6:33** – “Fear not to do good, my sons.” Charity grows as we learn to care for others out of genuine compassion.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph’s kindness to others, like when he welcomed visitors with warmth despite his own burdens, shows enlightened charity.

**Personal Reflection**: I feel this level of charity when I’m moved by someone’s struggles and act to help, even if it’s inconvenient.

### Covenant: Christ-Like Charity

**Scripture**: **D&C 4:6** – Charity as a covenantal virtue becomes the pure love of Christ, driving selfless service.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph’s sacrifices for the Saints, like enduring poverty to serve, reflect covenant charity.

**Personal Reflection**: Covenant charity is a challenge for me, but when I serve others as part of my covenant with God, it transforms my perspective.

### Sanctification: Pure, Divine Charity

**Scripture**: **D&C 6:9** – Charity fully aligned with repentance and salvation for others.

**Joseph’s Story**: Joseph’s ability to forgive enemies and seek their welfare reflects sanctified charity.

**Personal Reflection**: Sanctified charity is my aspiration—to love others as God loves them, without judgment or expectation.

------

## Love

A divine attribute that encompasses faith in God, hope in His promises, and charity toward others. True love is expressed through obedience, selfless service, and a Christlike desire for the eternal welfare of others. Love is the greatest commandment and the foundation of all righteousness.

### Terrestrial: Conditional Love

**Scripture**: **D&C 3:7** – Joseph’s love for Martin Harris temporarily outweighs his love for God’s commands, showing the conditional, human level of love.

### Enlightenment: Growing Divine Love

**Scripture**: **D&C 10:55** – The Lord speaks of His love for His children, reminding Joseph that true love seeks the eternal good of others. Joseph begins to embrace this divine perspective in his leadership.

### Covenant: Committed Love

**Scripture**: **D&C 4:5–6** – Love tied to covenant includes diligence, humility, and patience in serving God and others. Joseph’s role as a prophet is deeply rooted in this covenantal love.

### Sanctification: Christ-like Love

**Scripture**: **D&C 11:12** – “Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good.” Perfect love aligns completely with the Spirit, as Joseph demonstrates in his willingness to sacrifice all for the work of the Lord.

## Oliver Cowdery’s Lessons in Revelation

In the early days of the Church, Oliver Cowdery—like many of us—was learning how to receive revelation, step by step. Through his experiences with Joseph Smith, we see that the Lord is not always absolute in directing every detail of our lives. Instead, He often allows us to choose between multiple good paths according to our desires.

### D&C 6, 8-9 - Revelation

Oliver's story highlights different ways the Lord provides guidance and correction:

- **D&C 6:23** – "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?"
- **D&C 8:2-3** – Revelation comes to both the mind and heart.
- **D&C 9:8-9** – We must study things out before seeking confirmation.

------

## Multiple Paths

- **Elder Jeffrey R. Holland** taught that sometimes the Lord even lets us take a path that isn’t ideal so we can learn and gain confidence in the right one (2013).
- **Elder Dallin H. Oaks** explained that while some choices may be better than others, many decisions in life don’t have a single "correct" answer (2007).
- **President Russell M. Nelson** emphasized that receiving revelation requires effort, faith, and acting on promptings, even when multiple options are before us (April 2022).

### Elder Jeffrey R. Holland – "Wrong Roads"

In a CES fireside (Jan. 13, 2013), Elder Holland shared a personal story of traveling with his son. They reached a fork in the road, prayed, and felt prompted to take a certain path—only to quickly realize it was the wrong one. The Lord allowed this because it helped them know with certainty that the other path was correct.

**Lesson**: Sometimes the Lord allows us to take different paths so we can learn and grow from experience.

### Elder Dallin H. Oaks – "Good, Better, Best" (Oct. 2007 General Conference)

Elder Oaks taught that often there are multiple good choices in life, and the Lord lets us exercise agency in choosing between them. While some options may be “better” or “best,” the Lord doesn’t dictate every step we take.

**Lesson**: The Lord often allows us to make choices based on our desires, and as long as they align with righteous principles, He supports us.

### President Russell M. Nelson – "Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives" (Apr. 2018 General Conference)

President Nelson emphasized that receiving personal revelation is key to our spiritual survival. He also taught that the Lord expects us to act in faith and make decisions while seeking guidance.

"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great."

**Lesson**: Revelation often requires personal effort, and the Lord may allow multiple paths as long as they lead to good outcomes. His message indicates that small, consistent efforts—like repentance, prayer, and seeking revelation—create lasting spiritual momentum.
