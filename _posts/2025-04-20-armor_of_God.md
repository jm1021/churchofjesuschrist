## Revelation on the Armor (D&C 27)

### The Sacrament connects to the Atonement

2 For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my gloryâ€”remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.

### The Angels brought the keys

5 Behold, this is wisdom in me; wherefore, marvel not, for the hour cometh that I will drink of the fruit of the vine with you on the earth, and with **Moroni**, whom I have sent unto you to reveal the Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting gospel, to whom I have committed **the keys of the record of the stick of Ephraim**;

6 And also with **Elias**, to whom I have committed **the keys of bringing to pass the restoration of all things** spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began, concerning the last days;

7 And also John the son of Zacharias, which Zacharias he (Elias) visited and gave promise that he should have a son, and his name should be John, and he should be filled with the spirit of Elias;

8 Which **John** I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto the first priesthood which you have received, **that you might be called and ordained even as Aaron**;

9 And also **Elijah**, unto whom I have committed **the keys of the power of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the father**, that the whole earth may not be smitten with a curse;

10 And also with Joseph and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, your fathers, by whom the promises remain;

11 And also with Michael, or Adam, the father of all, the prince of all, the ancient of days;

12 And also with **Peter, and James, and John**, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles, and especial witnesses of my name, and bear **the keys of your ministry and of the same things which I revealed unto them**;

13 **Unto whom I have committed the keys of my kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last times; and for the fulness of times**, in the which I will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;

14 And also with all those whom my Father hath given me out of the world.

### The Armor of God given through angelic keys provides Fortification

15 Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and **take upon you my whole armor**, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand.

--- Stand in adversity ---

16 Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, having on the **breastplate of righteousness**, and **your feet shod** with the preparation of the gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels to commit unto you;

--- Provided armor by the angels mentioned ---

17 Taking the **shield of faith** wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked;

--- Use the gifts have been give to us. ---

18 And take the **helmet of salvation**, and the **sword of my Spirit**, which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be caught up, that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.

--- Work with the armor and spirt and we will be in the presence of God ---

## Faith, Charity, Virtue  (D&C 121)

45 **Let thy bowels also be full of charity** towards all men, and to the household of faith, and **let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly**; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.

--- Sanctify ourselves through Charity, Faith, and Virtue ---

46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.

--- The Holy Ghost and gifts become a scepter forever ---

### President Nelson

When I speak of having confidence before God, **I am referring to having confidence in approaching God right now!** I am referring to praying with confidence that Heavenly Father hears us, that He understands our needs better than we do. I am referring to having confidence that He loves us more than we can comprehend, that He sends angels to be with us and with those we love. I am referring to having confidence that He yearns to help each of us reach our highest potential.

-- Prayer, Woship, Temple bring confidence, comprehension, angels, and reaching our potential.
