## A Bright Night

### Samuel the Lamanite

**Helaman 14:3**: "And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day."

### Those who believed Samuel

**3 Nephi 1:13**: "Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world."

**3 Nephi 1:19**: "And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given."

### Star Bright Song

1. The heavens with light o’erflowing
   A story of love will tell.
   A new star will shine in glory
   When Jesus comes on earth to dwell.

   O star bright, the world is pining
   For you to turn night into the day.
   O star bright in heaven shining,
   Come, glow within me on Christmas Day.

2. Be joyful with eyes upturning,
   Beholding the time at hand.
   The night sign will soon be burning;
   He’s coming to our promised land.

   O star bright, the world is pining
   For you to turn night into the day.
   O star bright in heaven shining,
   Come, glow within me on Christmas Day.

3. Our Father with love is sending
   The Christ child to conquer strife.
   His mercy to all extending,
   He’s bringing everlasting life.

   O star bright, the world is pining
   For you to turn night into the day.
   O star bright in heaven shining,
   Come, glow within me on Christmas Day.

## Mary and Joseph

### Joseph and Mary's Travels

**Luke 2:1-7**:

1. "And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
2. "(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)"
3. "And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
4. "And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
5. "To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
6. "And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
7. "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."

### Away in a Manger Song

1. Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
   The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;
   The stars in the heavens looked down where he lay,
   The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Savior in a stall!
   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Lord of all.

2. The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes;
   But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
   I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky
   And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Savior in a stall!
   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Lord of all.

3. Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
   Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
   Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
   And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Savior in a stall!
   Asleep, (Asleep,) asleep, (asleep,)
   asleep, the Lord of all.
