## Sprititual Progression

An exploration on how faith, hope, charity, and love deepen as we progress spiritually. We’ll use four levels: terrestrial (basic), enlightenment (awakening), covenant (commitment), and sanctification (divine alignment)

### Scriptural Basis

**D&C 4:5–6:** “Faith, hope, charity, and love, with an eye single to the glory of God…”

These qualities are foundational for discipleship.

**Progression:** We don’t achieve perfect faith, hope, charity, or love all at once. Instead, God helps us grow step by step.

### Terrestrial Faith (Basic, Self-Reliant)

Definition: Faith rooted in worldly systems or self-reliance, often fragile under pressure.

**D&C 3:7** – Joseph feared man more than God in losing the 116 pages.

Joseph’s Story: Losing the manuscript showed how earthly concerns (e.g., pleasing Martin Harris) can undermine faith.

Personal Application: Share a story of when you (or someone relatable) trusted more in people or circumstances than in God.

### Enlightenment Faith (Awakening)

Definition: Faith grows as we experience God’s mercy and guidance, but we may still waver under life’s demands.

**D&C 6:14** – Joseph learns that faith brings blessings and instruction.

Joseph’s Story: After repenting for the 116 pages, Joseph learned to trust God more deeply.

Personal Application: When have you turned back to God after realizing you couldn’t handle something on your own?

### Covenant Faith (Commitment)

Definition: Faith that aligns with covenants and discipleship, shaping our actions and priorities.

**D&C 4:5** – Faith tied to “an eye single to the glory of God.

Joseph’s Story: Joseph’s unwavering dedication to translating the Book of Mormon reflects covenant-level faith.

Personal Application: How has keeping a covenant strengthened your faith?

### Sanctified Faith (Perfect Trust)

Definition: Faith that is pure and unwavering, fully aligned with God’s will.

**D&C 6:36** – Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.

Joseph’s Story: Joseph showed sanctified faith in Zion’s Camp and his later leadership of the Church.

Personal Application: What would it look like to trust God completely in your life?

## Class Activity followd by Group Sharing

Personal Reflection on Levels.

Write in notes the four levels mentioned.  In groups of four discuss each level and write or discuss an experiences with faith, hope, charity, and love at each level.

**Example:** “In what ways is your hope still tied to earthly things? Where have you felt covenant-level hope, trusting in God’s promises?”

Remember honesty in discussion, growth is a process. Please, (if comfortable), share insights about your current level and how you hope to progress.

### The Goal of Sanctification

**D&C 11:12–14** - The Spirit leads us to do good, love God, and trust in divine promises.

“Sanctification isn’t perfection we achieve on our own; it’s a process of aligning our lives with Christ through faith, hope, charity, and love.”
Challenge:

Personal Application: “What small step could you take this week to grow in your faith, hope, charity, or love?”
