## Stuggling to maintain unity (Today and in Greece)
Is there some way Sunday School could do better at building community?  I am thinking both in and outside of Sunday School class. 

Community/Bond.  A week ago, My wife and I went to a Duran Duran concert.  We saw Peter Bybee and Tex, Julie Prows.  This week my wife saw Tauna Lang at Costco.  In both these scenarios, we had a "bond, connection, or community" feeling; even thought we don't see or talk to these people often. Think of the Mathematical possibility that we would even bump into a member.  Does the Lord bolster us, to have these situations.

### Separated by Accomplishment
About 40 million Americans have left "the church" in the last 25 years.  This is referring to Christian Churches.  Often it comes do to lack of bond or community. 

[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/) ...
Draws on surveys of more than 7,000 Americans ... America simply isn’t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success.  ... little time or energy for forms of community ...

### Bonded through Jesus and Covenant
We need to praise or relationship with Jesus (Testimony), the Sacrament, and Baptism.  We glory in Spirit and Testimony.

<mark>1 Corinthians 10</mark>
16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

<mark>1 Corinthians 12</mark>
13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

### Opportunity to Share a Bond
What do you need to bond and establish community?

## Spiritual Gifts (Super Powers)
Recently, I see in society, the discussion of "what is your super power?"  or "what super power do you wish you had?"

In a quick Google, "Discover your Super Power", I saw a video talkin' about [7 super powers](https://youtu.be/AFjmCBbGckw?t=140); this man claims to have two;  he talks about other having different powers that complement him in his professional teams.

### What are [Spiritual Gifts](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/spiritual-gifts?lang=eng)?

Take a quick read of this [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/spiritual-gifts?lang=eng) and read below.   Then share what you thinks is a personal "spiritual gift", that can help profit us today.

1 Corinthians 12 — New Living Translation (NLT)
7 A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.

1 Corinthians 12 — GOD’S WORD Translation (GW)

[1 Corinthians 12:8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)
8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues
