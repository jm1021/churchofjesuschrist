## Preexistence
> [Premortality](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/premortality?lang=eng) is an amazing study.  In relating with people of other faiths, Jeremiah is an awesome starting point on the topic of preexistence or foreordination.  
- Biblical Translations of Jeremiah 1:5
    - KJV: [King James Version](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=5#p4)
    ```
    Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
    ``` 

    - NIV: New International Version
    ```
    “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
    ```

    - NLT: New Living Translation
    ```
    “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”
    ```

## Lord gives us lots of opportunities
> "How do I keep from backsliding?"  Backsliding is mentioned over and over in Jeremiah 3.  Thoughts infused by conference...
- The Covenant Path has many on ramps.  We continue to repent.  If we are asking the question, we are on the right path.  Keep trending upward.
- Fill your life with positive events.  Hobbies, music, scriptures and do many thing which are wholesome.
- Keep coming back to the Sacrament.  Keep renewing that covenant.  
- In my life, I have felt that ***one little backslide*** has helped me know where ***the true joy*** in life is through the commandments.

> Jeremiah 3
14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

## Scriptures used to overcome Evil
> "How do the scriptures turn me away from evil?"  Jeremiah has a great story on the process of writing and rewriting scripture.  Thoughts infused by conference...
- The very act of trying to have God in your life will turn you away from evil.  Our disposition to do evil will go away.
- Or, the very act of looking to increase our own testimonies will bring the spirit.  We may see many turn away from the scriptures, but with the spirit increased as we read the scriptures we can prevail.
- Try to be in the spirit of the people of that day, enter into their zone.

> Jeremiah 36
2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken ...
3 ... I purpose to do unto them; that they may ***return every man from his evil way***; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and aBaruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord’s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
27 ¶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, ***all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not***.
32 ¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the ascribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and ***there were added besides unto them many like words***.

> As Jeremiah rewrote the versus it seemed like it was a process to receive more revelation.  In my life, when I rewrite my thoughts and go over things, I find I have more to say.  Even as years transpire, I have more to add.  Writing begats more writing.

## Covenants -- Why the Old Testament
> Sometimes I think the Old Testament is weird.  But, a big thing I have received in this round of study is seeing sacrifice and covenants.  Our oldest scripture, unite very well with our modern revelation. Jeremiah speaks of covenants.  They shall be my people and I shall be their God.  [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=31-34#p31), [Jeremiah 32:37–42](Jeremiah 32:37–42)
- <mark>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: And I will give them one heart, and one way</mark>

> So "who are we?".   Here is a synopsis of "2 hours with us" as we try to be people of God, plus some quotes from our prophets.

### Betsy Dam
> Spoke on agency and the cunning of the adversary.   She said that joy comes in and through Gospel of Jesus Christ.  <mark>She prayed for our ability to make great choices</mark>.

### Mark Cuthbert
> Sacrifice.  Adam and Eve were told to worship the Lord and sacrifice the first king of the flock.  Jesus, part man and part God personally experience all loss and foolishness.  Jesus did this as live of all mankind.  <mark>Bring are hearts into submission</mark>, love mankind, practice becoming celestial beings.  Reflect light and love of God.

## I saw visions of God.
> Ezekiel is the prophet of captivity.  Taken away from the destroyed Jerusalem, as prophesied by Jeremiah.  Ezekiel is a contemporary of Nephi who was taken to a new land as a result of the prophecies of Jeremiah and following the direction of his Father. [Lesson](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/old-testament-seminary-teacher-manual/introduction-to-the-book-of-ezekiel/lesson-139-ezekiel-1-3?lang=eng)


> Ezekiel has a revelation like vision.   Kind of fun to speculate that he was seeing things that sound like engines and planes... According to Old Testament manual "the full meaning of Ezekiel’s vision has not yet been revealed to us by the Lord".
1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as ***I was among the captives*** by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the ***likeness of a man***.
the living creature was in the wheels.
21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

> Eat the Roll.  So, why would we eat the roll.  How does this apply to us today.
1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; ***eat this roll***, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.


# Stick of Judah and stick of Joseph
> Old Testament prophecy of the Book of Mormon.  [Lesson](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/old-testament-seminary-teacher-manual/introduction-to-the-book-of-ezekiel/lesson-142-ezekiel-37?lang=eng)
15 ¶ The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,
16 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For cJudah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For eJoseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:
17 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.
18 ¶ And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
19 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of aJoseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.

> From the lesson
- “Commonly translated stick, the Hebrew word used is etz, a generic word meaning ‘wood’ (there are other words meaning ‘stick,’ ‘staff,’ ‘branch,’ or ‘scepter’). This was wood upon which it was possible to write. Babylonian writing tablets of wood have been found hinged together and faced with wax, with writing engraved on them. Two wooden tablets represent the scriptures from Judah (the Bible) and Joseph (the Book of Mormon) to ‘be one in mine hand’ (Ezek. 37:15–19 and fn.)” (A Latter-day Saint Commentary on the Old Testament [1993], 608).
- In addition, while serving as an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, Keith Meservy commented on the discovery of some ancient wooden tablets:
- “The discovery in 1953 of these writing boards from biblical Calah in Mesopotamia altered the thinking of scholars about how Middle Eastern cultures made records. Wooden tablets filled with wax represent the ‘earliest known form of ancient book’ and help us understand an important prophecy of Ezekiel foretelling the uniting of the Bible and Book of Mormon” (“Ezekiel’s Sticks and the Gathering of Israel,” Ensign, Feb. 1987, 4).
- Ezekiel’s prophecy that the two sticks would be joined “one to another into one stick” (Ezekiel 37:17) is clarified by the phrase “shall grow together,” which is found in 2 Nephi 3:12. This phrase helps us understand that the joining together of the two sticks is a process that will occur over time.
