## Thoughts from Moroni (Ether 12)

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for **ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith**.

27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. **I give unto men weakness that they may be humble**; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.

28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and **I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness**.

### Power of Faith

31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; **for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power.**

### Hope in the resourection

32 **And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope;** wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.

### An appreciation of Charity, the pure love of Christ

36 And it came to pass that **I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity**.

## Promised Land (Ether 6)

2 For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.

8 And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.

11 And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and four days upon the water.

12 And they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.

## Book of Ether

The Book of Ether and a nation that falls.  There are so many Kings ... some good ... many more bad.  

There is an awful war which ends with Coriantumr and Kish.   Simpy put, people show the ability to destroy each other out of hatred, till the end of their nation.  Ether records the events, from a cavity of a rock.  Only Ether remains.

15:34 Now the last words which are written by Ether are these: Whether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.

What do we learn from the Jaredites?
