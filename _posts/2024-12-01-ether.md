## Thoughts from Moroni

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for **ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith**.

28 Behold, **I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness**, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness.

### Power of Faith

31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; **for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power.**

### Hope in the resourection

32 **And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope;** wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.

### An appreciation of Charity, the pure love of Christ

36 And it came to pass that **I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity**.
