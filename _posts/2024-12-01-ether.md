## Barges - Ether 6

A journey at sea, an adventure, many mysteries on how it was so.

2 For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and **he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof**; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.

7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, **their vessels being tight like unto a dish**, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.

8 And it came to pass that **the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters**; and thus they were driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, **they did not cease to praise the Lord**.

11 And thus they were driven forth, **three hundred and forty and four days** upon the water.

12 And they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and **did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them**.

## Faith, Hope, Charity - Ether 12

For me, these words support my day-to-day outlook in the gospel.

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for **ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith**.

27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. **I give unto men weakness that they may be humble**; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.

28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and **I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness**.

### Power of Faith

31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; **for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power.**

### Hope in the resourection

32 **And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope;** wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.

### An appreciation of Charity, the pure love of Christ

36 And it came to pass that **I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity**.

## Book of Ether

IMO, te story of the Jaredites is a sorrowful tale.

12:4 Wherefore, **whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world**, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.

Moroni wrote, “**it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you … that evil may be done away**, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men”

The Book of Ether recounts **the rise and fall of the Jaredite nation**. There are many kings, some good but many more bad. The narrative highlights the destructive power of pride and wickedness.

The book culminates in an awful war that ends with Coriantumr and Shiz. Simply put, **the people show their ability to destroy each other out of hatred**, leading to the end of their nation. Ether records these events from the safety of a cavity in a rock, and ultimately, **only Ether remains**.

15:34 Ether's final words encapsulate his unwavering faith: **Whether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.**

### Key Messages and Themes

1. **Pride and Wickedness**: The repeated cycle of pride and wickedness among the Jaredites leads to their downfall. The story serves as a warning about the dangers of a nation turning away from God.

2. **The Role of Prophets**: Ether, as a prophet, faithfully records the events and warns the people, even though they do not heed his warnings. His dedication to his calling, despite the circumstances, is a testament to his faith and perseverance.

3. **The Consequences of War**: The final chapters of Ether describe the devastating effects of war, illustrating how unchecked hatred and violence can lead to the complete destruction of a society.
