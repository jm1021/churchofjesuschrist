## Happy New Year
Resolutions?

I felt very blessed to remember the life of Jesus Christ during the Christmas season.  But, as a resolution, perhaps being excited about a year of study centered on the Book of Mormon can count.

Last week the Bishop introduced the BOM a bit, here are my recordings.  My observation during the CFM study, these questions were in the lesson.  


### What is the Book of Mormon?

- Another testament of Jesus Christ

- A book with a promise of personal conversion

- A book with the ability to learn more about Jesus Christ, to understand his atonement and other personally impacting doctrine

- A book that promises the Gift of the Holy Ghost 


### What would be missing in my life without the BOM?

- The day I knelled to ask God if it were true. 

- The miracles of personal revelation.

- The process of reading the BOM and changing my life.

- Understanding the power of God the BOM reveals, even the Holy Ghost.

**Does anyone have any **immediate thoughts** about the Bishop's comments? or the BOM?**

## [Title Page of BOM](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng)

An Account ** written by THE HAND OF MORMON **

Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also **to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy** and of revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, **to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift of God**.

An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven—Which is **to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord**, that they are not cast off forever—And also to the **convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God**, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, **if there are faults they are the mistakes of men**; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, Jun.

### Look at the BOM in different ways
How do we actively engage with the scriptures, apply the teachings to our lives, and recognize the relevance of the Book of Mormon to our journeys? 

Read these scriptures by yourself or with a neighbor.  Think about **"how you will look at the BOM in different ways this year?"**

"to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers, and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever"

2 Nephi 1:14:
"Awake! And arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of all the earth."

2 Nephi 33:10-15:
Nephi's concluding words emphasize the power of the scriptures to speak from the dust and the importance of likening the scriptures to ourselves.

2 Nephi 4:15-16:
"For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard."

Helaman 3:29-30:
"Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked—And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out."
