## Happy New Year
Resolutions?

I felt very blessed to remember the life of Jesus Christ during the Christmas season.  But, as a resolution, I am excited about a year of study centered on the Book of Mormon. 

Last week the Bishop introduced the BOM a bit, here are my recordings.  My observation during the CFM study, these questions were in the lesson.  

**Does anyone have any **immediate thoughts** about the Bishop's comments?**

### What is the Book of Mormon?

- Another testament of Jesus Christ

- A book with a promise of personal conversion

- A book with the ability to learn more about Jesus Christ, to understand his atonement and other personally impacting doctrine

- A book that promises the Gift of the Holy Ghost 


### What would be missing in my life without the BOM?

- The day I knelled to ask God if it were true. 

- The miracles of personal revelation.

- The process of reading the BOM and changing my life.

- Understanding the power of God reveals his truth to me through the Holy Ghost.
