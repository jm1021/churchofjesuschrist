## Best Intentions [#LightTheWorld](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/light-the-world)
Best intentions sometimes mess up. The month of November was full of resets on my service plans.

Train Day. I was trying to "serve" my Father-in-Law, but the room setup did not work out the way I expected.   Sorry, Roy, Tiernan, Shay and others.  Service should not be by my parameters.

Thanksgiving with my Daughter.  I tried to give gas money to my daughter during Thanksgiving with the intent to have a fun visit.  Sorry Claire... I will try to keep sickness to my own time.

Church Talk.  The day after we took Shay to emergency and the day after he had bacterial meningitis.  Service plans, work, and the world seem to stand still in this type of crisis.

God is love, family is love.  We will finally get back to our Train day this afternoon, thanks to the service to me by Lora.  Claire came and visited in a time of need, she provided me with service.  Shay overcame and is back on his feet, thanks to many many tender mercies of the Lord and service by Nurses and Doctors.

## Revelations 2 (God Provides, cross reference 1 Nephi 8 & 11)
Tree of Life and a new name.  These blessings sometimes are thought of as beyond the world.  But we can have the blessing of the knowledge of the tree of life now.

7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the **tree of life**, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of **the hidden manna**, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone **a new name** written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

## Revelations 7 (Temple Blessings)
Promised blessings flow to those who choose to remain faithful and follow the Lord.  The Temple is central to overcoming. 
 The pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God. D&C 97:15-16
 You will feel God’s power. D&C 109:13
 You will learn words of wisdom. D&C 109:14-15

13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are **these which are arrayed in white robes**? and whence came they?

14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, **These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb**.

15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, **and serve him day and night in his temple**: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.

16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

17 For **the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them**, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and **God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes**.

## Revelation 12 (War in Heaven, cross reference to Moses 4:1-4)
Revelation backtracks to talk about the plan, before it talks of the 7th seal.  This is foundational to our knowledge.

7 And there was **war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon**; and the dragon fought and his angels,

9 And the **great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan**, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, **Now is come salvation**, and strength, and **the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ**: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

11 And **they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony**; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

## Revelation 14 (7th Seal, cross reference to D&C 4)
A Marvelous work is the start of the 7th Seal.

6 And **I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel** to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

7 Saying with a loud voice, **Fear God, and give glory to him**; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

12 Here is the patience of the saints: **here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus**.

13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, **Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord** from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and **their works do follow them**.

15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, **Thrust in thy sickle**, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for **the harvest of the earth is ripe**.

## Reason for the Season (Birth of Jesus Christ)
“Christmas is not only a celebration of how Jesus came into the world but also of **knowing who He is—our Lord and Savior**, Jesus Christ—and of why He came”

### Jesus fulfilled his mission

[1 Corinthians 15:21–26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=21-26#p21)
21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.

22 **For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.**

23 But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.

24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

26 **The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death**.

[1 Peter 2:21–25]()

21 For even hereunto were ye called: because **Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps**:

22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:

24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

25 **For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls**.
