### Themes and Pictures
- Review themes <mark>The Lord is My Shepherd</mark> and <mark>I Will Declare What He Hath Done for My Soul</mark> which are the themes from part 1 and 2 of 3 of Psalms lessons.  What do these theme me to you?
- Now focus on on the image of <mark>Jesus walking with Sheep</mark>. Is this an analogy? <mark>Next look at Jesus with a lantern</mark>. Does this complement the first picture?  Do both pictures complement the theme?   How does this make you reflect on Psalms versus New Testament?  What Psalm?

### How Great Thou Art
> I struggle with Psalms, so I am always looking for connections.
| Psalms 8      | How Great Thou Art |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;| O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder; Consider all the works Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed!, |
| 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! | When thru the woods and forest glades I wander; And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur; And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,|
| 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:| When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation; And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration; And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!|

> As I make these connections my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change.  Not by just reading but trying to connect.  In Sabre Spring history, one Sunday we had Alex Boye visit us and proclaim and testify of this Psalm/Hymn. Image this at our pulpit.

    Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
    How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
    Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
    How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
