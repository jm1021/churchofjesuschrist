### Themes and Pictures
- Review themes <mark>The Lord is My Shepherd</mark> and <mark>I Will Declare What He Hath Done for My Soul</mark> which are the themes from part 1 and 2 of 3 of Psalms lessons.  What do these theme me to you?
- Now focus on on the image of <mark>Jesus walking with Sheep</mark>. Is this an analogy? <mark>Next look at Jesus with a lantern</mark>. Does this complement the first picture?  Do both pictures complement the theme?   How does this make you reflect on Psalms versus New Testament?  What Psalm?
