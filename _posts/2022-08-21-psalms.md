### Themes and Pictures
- Review themes <mark>The Lord is My Shepherd</mark> and <mark>I Will Declare What He Hath Done for My Soul</mark>. These are the themes from part 1 and 2 of 3 of Psalms lessons.  What do these theme me to you?  Do you know where to find a corresponding Psalm?
- Now focus on on the image of <mark>Jesus walking with Sheep</mark>. Is this an analogy? <mark>Next look at Jesus with a lantern</mark>. Does this complement the first picture?  Do both pictures complement the theme?   How does this make you reflect on Psalms versus New Testament?  What Psalm?

### How Great Thou Art
> I struggle with pure Psalm reading, so I am always looking for new connections.

| Psalms 8      | How Great Thou Art |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;| O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder; Consider all the works Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed!, |
| 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! | When thru the woods and forest glades I wander; And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur; And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,|
| 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:| When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation; And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration; And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!|

> As I make these connections my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change.  Not by just reading but trying to connect.  In Sabre Spring history, one Sunday we had Alex Boye visit us and proclaim and testify of this Psalm/Hymn. Image this at our pulpit.  [Alex Boye accompanied by Mark Smith](https://youtu.be/_UTq190RInA?t=2330
    Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
    How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
    Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;
    How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

### The modern Psalmist
> I love our Tabernacle choir.  Conference with the choir, finding Mustache guy and debating about the four armed Organ player are part of our conference tradition.  Also, singing with the Choir at home sometimes lets inhibition go free.  We are not alone, or at least I am not alone, in ancient and current times we find traditions and people that love Psalm.

Psalms 23 by the [Mormon Tabernacle Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIz-b3FLwe4)
1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

> A psalm is defined as a sacred song or hymn. David wrote 70 plus Psalms and had traditions and glories in rejoicing with the Lord.  
2 Samuel 6:5
    And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord
    on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, 
    even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, 
    and on cornets, and on cymbals.
2 Samuel 6:14-15
    14 And <mark>David danced before the Lord with all his might</mark>; 
    and David was girded with a linen ephod.
    15 So David and all the house of Israel 
    brought up the ark of the Lord with <mark>shouting</mark>, 
    and with the sound of the trumpet.

> As a body of believers and those that love the Lord we can sing and listen to Psalms from many perspectives and perhaps even different styles.  [David Archuleta sings to Tabernacle Choir](https://youtu.be/pV3DEtJtho8?t=131)

- Psalms 46
    10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
- Psalms 131
    2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
- TLV Psalms 131, even reading Psalms in different translations could add clarity
    2 But I have calmed and quieted my soul— like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
- Be Still My Soul 
    Be still, my soul, thy God doth undertake
    To guide the future as He has the past
    Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake
    All now mysterious shall be bright at last
    Be still, my soul, the waves and winds still know
    His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below

> The Psalms continue to be sung with music today.  Song, emotions and dancing are represented differently by groups of faith everywhere.  IMO, I obtain more from a Psalm if I can experience it in manners as recorded in Samuel.
Psalms 34 by the [Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIz-b3FLwe4)
    4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
    5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
    6 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
    7 The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
