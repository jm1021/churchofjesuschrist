## Life struggles
Paul talks about his personal struggles, can we relate?  King James words are tricky, so some other help is provided.

[Romans 7:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/7?lang=eng&id=p14-p15#p14)

King James
14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.

The New International Version (NIV)
14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.

New Living Translation (NLT)
14 So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin. 15 I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate.

### Sione Havili mistake
Oct 2nd Conference preview [Sione Havili](https://ksltv.com/473425/preview-conference-doc-redeemed-the-sione-havili-story/) story revolves around go on a mission after burning down a house.  Having to leave his mission at 14 months to go to jail.

### Peter and James council
These great leaders needed to figure hard things out, so Jew and Gentile converts could at least eat together.  The law?  The spirit?  The differences?

```
This council met to discuss ...

1. "the issue of what Gentiles (non-Jews) 
should do when converting to Christianity" 
2. "religious and ethnic background"
3. "inclusion into the emerging Christian Church"
``````

James suggested the Gentiles should abstain from at least four things related to keeping the law of Moses ([Acts 15:20, 29](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/15?lang=eng&id=20,29#p20)).   

IMO, this is like the baptismal inteview or temple recomment interiew questions. Imagine an interview ...

1. do you participate in cermonies where ... Meats are offered to idols ?

2. do you have unrepented sins like ... Fornication (sexual immorality) ?

3. do you eat ... Strangled meat (the animal’s blood had not been drained) ?

4. do you eat ... Blood (related to avoiding strangled meat) or Blood pudding?

## Live by the Spirit
How do you live by the spirit?  My spiritual life is enhanced by my time in my Car.


### Sons (and Daughters) of God
Is there a formula?  Or is it a birthright?

[Romans 8:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the [sons and daughters of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/sons-and-daughters-of-god?lang=eng)

```
Repent and be baptized, and have your sins remitted,
And get the Spirit’s zeal; oh, then you’ll be united.
Go cast upon him all your care;
He will regard your humble prayer
```

### Joint Heirs with Christ
Is this a contract?  What does heir mean?  Does this make you feel great?

[Romans 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

### Understanding Grace
Why is it so important to gain an understanding about
grace?  David Lang forwarded me an article, I made some adaptations.
- <mark>Atonement</mark>. Appreciate and take full advantage of the atonement of Jesus Christ.  Become Sons and Daughters of God.
- <mark>Covenants</mark>. Gain enabling relationships with God the Father and His Son.  Because of Jesus’ atonement, a grace (charis) relationship enables us to become like Heavenly Father. Become joint-errors with Jesus.
- <mark>Faith, Reciprocal Relationship</mark>. Gain more spiritual gifts and blessings as we receive the gifts God has already given. Anciently, all gifts are reciprocal, covenantal and establish relationships.


Faith, enabling power for grace. [Romans 9:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/9?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) 
Wherefore? Because <mark>they sought it not by faith</mark>, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

Repentance/Confess, proclaim Jesus. [Romans 10:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/10?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)
That if <mark>thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus</mark>, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Baptism, a new life.  [Romans 6:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/6?lang=eng&id=p4-p5#p4)
4 Therefore we are <mark>buried with him by baptism</mark> into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should <mark>walk in newness of life<mark>. 5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

Spirit, the gift of righteous acts. [Romans 8:8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)
8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but <mark>the Spirit is life because of righteousness</mark>.

Prayer, leads to life eternal. [Romans 10:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)
For whosoever shall <mark>call upon the name of the Lord</mark> shall be saved.

Church, bolsters faith. [Romans 10:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/10?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)
So then <mark>faith cometh by hearing</mark>, and hearing by the word of God.
