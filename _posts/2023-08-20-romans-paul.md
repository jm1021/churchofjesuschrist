## Life struggles
Paul talks about his personal struggles, can we relate?  King James words are tricky, so some other help is provided.

[Romans 7:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/7?lang=eng&id=p14-p15#p14)

King James
14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.

The New International Version (NIV)
14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.

New Living Translation (NLT)
14 So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin. 15 I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate.

[Romans 8:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)
14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, <mark>they are the [sons of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/sons-and-daughters-of-god?lang=eng)</mark>.

#### Peter and James
These great leaders needed to figure hard things out, so Jew and Gentile converts could at least eat together.  The law?  The spirit?  The differences?

```
This council met to discuss ...

1. "the issue of what Gentiles (non-Jews) 
should do when converting to Christianity" 
2. "religious and ethnic background"
3. "inclusion into the emerging Christian Church"
``````

James suggested the Gentiles should abstain from at least four things related to keeping the law of Moses ([Acts 15:20, 29](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/15?lang=eng&id=20,29#p20)).   

IMO, this is like the baptismal inteview or temple recomment interiew questions. Imagine an interview ...

1. do you participate in cermonies where ... Meats are offered to idols ?

2. do you have unrepented sins like ... Fornication (sexual immorality) ?

3. do you eat ... Strangled meat (the animal’s blood had not been drained) ?

4. do you eat ... Blood (related to avoiding strangled meat) or Blood pudding?
