## Infinite Atonement
[2 Nephi 9:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

I have a book, Infinite Atonement, written by my former Stake President. He was a member of the Seventy or Sunday School. This chapter talks of the Savior and his provided gift, resurrection. It is very clear in this chapter and adds confidence to me.

### The Cross
[2 Nephi 9, Summary](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=study_summary1#study_summary1)
I went to Tucson to see my Aunt and Cousins from my Mother's hometown community in Tucson.

We had a great weekend to reflect on our family and history.  In fact, as a note to San Diego residents, my Mom's early childhood community was founded by a member of the Mormon battalion, Erastus Bingham Jr.  It was eventually settled by him and his son Nephi Bingham and his wife Elizabeth Dalkin.  We spent time at the Binghampton Ward, Binghampton Community, and Binghampton Cemetary.

Aunt Audrey, through marriage and other circumstances, is not regularly participating with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  My faithful and faith-filled Aunt married a Catholic and has participated with several other Christain Churches and charities.  Aunt Audrey remains to me a Saint and faithful daughter of God.  All the things she says to me will spiritually capture my attention.

In the Binghampton cemetery, my Aunt commented to me about the negative feelings she hears or sees regarding the Cross and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Brother and Sisters, I respect the Cross and consider it a great religious symbol and of key importance to me and many of those in Christian faiths.   It is part of the Infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ.  It is part of my stepdad's and Aunt's faith.  It is a part of me, though I have never worn a cross.  Somehow the cross, through my family has snuck its way into the Binghampton Cemetary.  I am an advocate of my family's traditions and am glad to see the cross on my Mother's headstone.

The preferred symbols used in representing Jesus are His prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane and the Resurrected Lord in the Christus statue.  We have a unique symbol of the Angel Moroni that adorns the top of the temples.   Inside temples and churches, we have Gospel Art. This art can contain images of Christ on the Cross.  Google will show art with crucifixion related to the Church.

The atonement is power over sin and death.   It leads us to overcome the death, and grave and reach towards our advocate who is the Living Christ.  Jesus's atonement includes His death on the cross.
