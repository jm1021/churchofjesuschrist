## Chronology of Kings 
From the assigned reading in Come Follow Me (and the Book of Mormon order), it may be hard to track the timeline from our sequential reading.

Here is a [Timeline](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/children/resources/topics/book-of-mormon/2011-10-06-book-of-mormon-time-line-eng.pdf)

### Zeniff and Ancestral Land
Zeniff (around 200 BC): He led a group of Nephites from Zarahemla to reclaim their ancestral lands (Lehi-Nephi), the land where Lehi first landed. However, they were captured and enslaved by the Lamanites.

Noah (Zeniff's son): He was a wicked king who persecuted the prophet Abinadi. Alma the Elder, originally one of Noah's priests, converted to Abinadi's teachings and fled with other believers.

Limhi (Noah's son 124 BC): He was a descendant of Zeniff who eventually led his people to escape from Lamanite captivity with the help of Ammon, a missionary sent by King Mosiah II.
Limhi led his people to reunite with the main Nephite population in Zarahemla. This reign signifies a temporary end to the separate lineage of kings descended from Zeniff.

## Mosiah I, Mosiah II and Zarhemla
Mosiah I:  He was a prophet who led a group of Nephites from the land of Nephi, the same as the land Zeniff tried to return, to Zarahemla after they were warned by the Lord. He became the first king of the combined people in Zarahemla and was the father of King Benjamin.

Mosiah II: This is the Mosiah you likely hear about more often. This is the King who sent Ammon to find out what had happened to Zeniff, as a generation or so had passed since they heard any word.  He was King Benjamin's son and the king referenced as Mosiah II in the Book of Mormon.  His reign is covered in detail in the Book of Mormon and is significant for events like the conversion of Alma the Younger and the establishment of a more Christ-centered government.
