## Chronology of Kings 
From the assigned reading in Come Follow Me (and the Book of Mormon order), it may be hard to track the timeline from our sequential reading.

Here is a [Timeline](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/children/resources/topics/book-of-mormon/2011-10-06-book-of-mormon-time-line-eng.pdf)

### Zeniff and Ancestral Land
Zeniff (around 200 BC): He led a group of Nephites from Zarahemla to reclaim their ancestral lands (Lehi-Nephi), the land where Lehi first landed. Initially, they are promised the land of Shilom.  Later they fought for their land and obtained their planned inheritance for 22 years.  Ultimately, they are taxed and enslaved by the Lamanites.

Noah (Zeniff's son): He was a wicked king who persecuted the prophet Abinadi. Alma the Elder, originally one of Noah's priests, converted to Abinadi's teachings and fled with other believers.

Limhi (Noah's son 124 BC): He was a descendant of Zeniff who eventually led his people to escape from Lamanite captivity with the help of Ammon, a missionary sent by King Mosiah II.  Limhi led his people to reunite with the main Nephite population in Zarahemla. This reign signifies an end to the separate lineage of kings descended from Zeniff.

### Mosiah I, Mosiah II and Zarhemla
Mosiah I:  He was a prophet who led a group of Nephites from the land of Nephi, the same as the land Zeniff tried to return, to Zarahemla after they were warned by the Lord. He became the first king of the combined people in Zarahemla and was the father of King Benjamin.

Mosiah II: This is the Mosiah you likely hear about more often. This is the King who sent Ammon to find out what had happened to Zeniff, as a generation or so had passed since they heard any word.  He was King Benjamin's son and the king referenced as Mosiah II in the Book of Mormon.  His reign is covered in detail in the Book of Mormon and is significant for events like the conversion of Alma the Younger and the establishment of a more Christ-centered government.

## Zeniff Writings
> Zeniff tells us of his quest.

Mosiah 9:3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land ...

> Zeniff updates on the state of the Lamanites in approximately 200 BC.  How do these verses relate to you in the workplace, society or news of today?  Do you know of bitter people or people that feel the were wronged?

Mosiah 10:11 ... Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.

Mosiah 10:12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;

> Zeniff unites his people and they win many battles and have a season of peace.  When can you call upon the Lord when fighting a war?  There are many stories in the Book of Mormon regarding the battles of the wicked versus the righteous.

Mosiah 10:19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.

## Noah and the Calling of Abinadi
From Zeniff to Noah there is a transition.  The leadership in the transition from father to son became just like those they formerly fought against.  Do we fear this of our country, leaders, our church?  

> Kingdom is conferred on Noah and he is unrighteous and burdens his people with tax.  The King, his court and Priest are idolitrous, unchaste, wine bibblers, and use taxes to build ornate buildings.  Lamanites start to attack in small numbers.

Mosiah 11:1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.

Mosiah 11:3 ... And he laid a tax of one-fifth part of all they possessed ...

Mosiah 11:19 ... they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood ...

> Abinadi come to preach.

Mosiah 11:20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.

Mosiah 11:21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.

> The Priest of Noah's court are confounded.  What meaneth on something that may seem obvious.  It is great to see the US military performing humanitarian aid this week in Gaza.  We should thank God that our leaders are looking to provide in humanitarian crisis.

Mosiah 12:20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:

Mosiah 12:21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth;

## Abinadi teaches the Atonement
> Here Abinadi is talking to people who say they live the law but do not. Abinadi introduces the atonement. 

Mosiah 13:28 I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish ...

> The Law was to simplify.  Honestly, I have never been able to handle simple instructions.  I thank the Lord that I live in a day where I can serve freely, trip on my mistakes, and repent!!!

Mosiah 13:30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God

> The doctrine of being redemed in God is an amazing blessing plan.  I praise God and his Son Jesus for the redemption opportunity.

Mosiah 13:32 ... for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.

> How do you/we experience intercession of Jesus?

Mosiah 14:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

Mosiah 15:8 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men.

Mosiah 15:9 ... standing betwixt them and justice; ... satisfied the demands of justice.

> The words here are mighty.  What does it mean "that they are his seed"?

Mosiah 15:11 ... whosoever has heard the words of the prophets ...

Mosiah 15:12 ... these are they whose sins he has borne; ... to redeem them from their transgressions ...

Mosiah 15: ... I say unto you that they are his seed.

## Abinadi answers the Priest
> At first, beautiful feet meant to mean is to perform good acts.  But in these versus we go much deeper.  It is those, whose hearts and souls, turn to Jesus.  They turn their live to Jesus and receive his atonement.

14 And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!

15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!

16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!

17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!

18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;

> There are times in my life where I have felt this first estate.  But, there are times I become forgetful.   But, in the grand picture I need to remember to point toward Jesus and everything will work its way out.

22 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.

23 They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.
