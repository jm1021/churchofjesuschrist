## Chronology of Kings 
From the assigned reading in Come Follow Me (and the Book of Mormon order), it may be hard to track the timeline from our sequential reading.

Here is a [Timeline](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/children/resources/topics/book-of-mormon/2011-10-06-book-of-mormon-time-line-eng.pdf)

### Zeniff and Ancestral Land
Zeniff (around 200 BC): He led a group of Nephites from Zarahemla to reclaim their ancestral lands (Lehi-Nephi), the land where Lehi first landed. Initially, they are promised the land of Shilom.  Later they fought for their land and obtained their planned inheritance for 22 years.  Ultimately, they are taxed and enslaved by the Lamanites.

Noah (Zeniff's son): He was a wicked king who persecuted the prophet Abinadi. Alma the Elder, originally one of Noah's priests, converted to Abinadi's teachings and fled with other believers.

Limhi (Noah's son 124 BC): He was a descendant of Zeniff who eventually led his people to escape from Lamanite captivity with the help of Ammon, a missionary sent by King Mosiah II.  Limhi led his people to reunite with the main Nephite population in Zarahemla. This reign signifies an end to the separate lineage of kings descended from Zeniff.

### Mosiah I, Mosiah II and Zarhemla
Mosiah I:  He was a prophet who led a group of Nephites from the land of Nephi, the same as the land Zeniff tried to return, to Zarahemla after they were warned by the Lord. He became the first king of the combined people in Zarahemla and was the father of King Benjamin.

Mosiah II: This is the Mosiah you likely hear about more often. This is the King who sent Ammon to find out what had happened to Zeniff, as a generation or so had passed since they heard any word.  He was King Benjamin's son and the king referenced as Mosiah II in the Book of Mormon.  His reign is covered in detail in the Book of Mormon and is significant for events like the conversion of Alma the Younger and the establishment of a more Christ-centered government.

## Zeniff Writings
> Zeniff tells us of his quest.

Mosiah 9:3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land ...

> Zeniff updates on the state of the Lamanites in approximately 200 BC.  How do these verses relate to you in the workplace, society or news of today?  Do you know of bitter people or people that feel the were wronged?

Mosiah 10:11 ... Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.

Mosiah 10:12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;

> Zeniff unites his people and they win many battles and have a season of peace.  When can you call upon the Lord when fighting a war?  There are many stories in the Book of Mormon regarding the battles of the wicked versus the righteous.

Mosiah 10:19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.

## Noah and the coming of Abinadi
From Zeniff to Noah there is a transition.  The leadership in the transition from father to son became just like those they formerly fought against.  Do we fear this of our country, leaders, our church?  

> Kingdom is conferred on Noah and he is unrighteous and burdens his people with tax.  The King, his court and Priest are idolitrous, unchaste, wine bibblers, and use taxes to build ornate buildings.  Lamanites start to attack in small numbers.

Mosiah 11:1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.

Mosiah 11:3 ... And he laid a tax of one-fifth part of all they possessed ...

Mosiah 11:19 ... they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood ...

> Abinadi come to preach.  [Twin Peaks Video](https://youtu.be/rUZKRZE6RhM?t=41)

Mosiah 11:20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.

Mosiah 11:21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.

> The Priest of Noah's court are confounded.  What meaneth on something that may seem obvious.  It is great to see the US military performing humanitarian aid this week in Gaza. Is that the meaning of the scripture "publisheth peace, good tidings of good"? 

Mosiah 12:20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:

Mosiah 12:21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth;

## Abinadi teaches the Atonement
> Abinadi on the Law, Atonement, and Intercession: Key Points and Questions

Mosiah 13:28 I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish ...

> the Law of Moses served a purpose to remind people of God.  Honestly, I have never been able to handle simple instructions. I thank the Lord for living in a time where I can learn and grow through mistakes, repent, and receive the Atonement's blessings. 

Mosiah 13:30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God

> The doctrine of being redemed in God is an amazing blessing of the plan.  I praise God and his Son Jesus for the redemption opportunity.

Mosiah 13:32 ... for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.

> The intercession refers to Jesus acting as a mediator between humanity and God. How do you/we experience intercession of Jesus?  

Mosiah 14:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

Mosiah 15:8 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men.

Mosiah 15:9 ... standing betwixt them and justice; ... satisfied the demands of justice.

> These words seem mighty, they provide guideance to hear the words.  What does it mean "that they are his seed"?

Mosiah 15:11 ... whosoever has heard the words of the prophets ...

Mosiah 15:12 ... these are they whose sins he has borne; ... to redeem them from their transgressions ...

Mosiah 15:13 ... I say unto you that they are his seed.

## Abinadi answers the Priest
> Initially, "beautiful feet" might suggest performing good deeds. However, these verses offer a richer understanding. It is more than just physical actions; it refers to a complete devotion to Jesus Christ and his teachings. These individuals dedicate their lives to sharing the gospel and helping others receive the blessings of the Atonement.

Mosiah 15:14 And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!

Mosiah 15:15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!

Mosiah 15:16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!

Mosiah 15:17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!

Mosiah 15:18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;

> There are times in my life when I've felt focused on outward actions, performing acts according to my initial understanding of "beautiful feet." However, these verses remind me to strive for a deeper conversion, one where my heart and soul are turned towards Jesus Christ. By focusing on sharing his teachings and living a Christ-centered life, I can contribute to the message of peace and ultimately rely on his Atonement for true consistent, and constant happiness.

Mosiah 15:22 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.

Mosiah 15:23 They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.

## Alma believes, Abinadi Slain
> As a returned missionary, I often reflect on the impact of my service. Abinadi, a prophet in the Book of Mormon, provides a powerful example. Though he seemingly only converted one person in King Noah's court – Alma – his testimony continues to inspire us today.

Mosiah 17:2 But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, ...

Mosiah 17:4 ... And he being concealed for many days did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken.

> Abinadi Seals his Testimony.  Abinadi's courage in facing death for his beliefs is a powerful example for missionaries.  Just as Abinadi faced fear, we may also hesitate to share our faith.  Perhaps we fear rejection, or social awkwardness.  However, Abinadi's story reminds us that our testimony of Jesus and the Gospel is worth any sacrifice.

Mosiah 17:20 And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.

## Ammon finds Limhi years after Abinadi
> Ammon is sent by Mosiah II to find the people that went to the land of Lehi-Nephi.  Ammon, after wondering for 30 days, took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem to the land of Nephi.

Mosiah 7:6 And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king’s guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison.

> After two days in prison, the were brought before King Limhi, the mystery of the people of Zeniff who left Zarahemla is revealed.

Mosiah 7:9 ... Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.

Mosiah 7:10 And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?

> Ammon replies to the King

Mosiah 7:13 For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land. 

> Limhi relates their fate

Mosiah 7:15 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne.  ... our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.

> Limhi declares repentance and words of Faith.   It is interesting to me in this backwards journey that the rich become worldly and that those in bondage turn to God.

Mosiah 7:19 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God...

Mosiah 7:20 ... it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.

Mosiah 7:26 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.

Mosiah 7:33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.

## A record of descendants of Zeniff, dialog on Seer
> Diligent Record Keeping. Even the people that left Zarahemla were diligence in keeping records.

Mosiah 8:5 And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.

> Limhi describes a journey where his scouts found evidence of a fallen civilization. These plates, later identified as Jaredite, serve as a testament to an ancient people who once inhabited the land.

Mosiah 8:9 And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.

> The Significance of a Seer.  This is significant because it foreshadows the translation of the Book of Mormon. The passages describe the role of seers, who possess the divinely given gift of the interpreters to translate ancient records. This concept lays the groundwork for how Joseph Smith, a modern seer, would translate the golden plates.

Mosiah 8:13 .. for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.

Mosiah 8:16 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.

Mosiah 8:17 But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.

Mosiah 8:18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.

## Tale of Wisdom
> We learn of wisdom as being a property that humanity tends to avoid, particulary when rich.   Also, we learn that wisdom has a female gender.

Mosiah 8:20 .. how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!

Mosiah 8:21 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.
