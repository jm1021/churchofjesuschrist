### Hebrews and its Origin

The authorship of the Book of Hebrews in the New Testament is a subject of debate and remains uncertain.  However,the King James bible says... "THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE HEBREWS".  

According to [James Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Goldberg) the entirety of the title page may be a lie [BYUTV Come Follow Up](https://www.byutv.org/0375bbf8-7020-48f7-80b6-d3a367d29163/come-follow-up-october-30-november-5-%7C-hebrews-1-6?player-open=true&content-id=0375bbf8-7020-48f7-80b6-d3a367d29163).   Perhaps you can speculate what that lie might be?

#### Alternate writers

James Goldberg and ChatGPT specify there can be many authors... including Paul, Barnabas, Apollos, Priscilla, or an unknown early Christian figure. However, no conclusive evidence exists to definitively identify the author.

Priscilla being involved with her husband Aquilla is a romantic notion of intersts.  It also lines up with some scholars ideas that languages is different between "we" of Hebrews versus "I" in most epistles.

- Hebrews 2:3-4 "How shall <b>we</b> escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to <b>us</b> by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."

versus

- Philemon 1:8-9: "Accordingly, though <b>I</b> am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake <b>I</b> prefer to appeal to you."

#### Greek language

James Goldberg hints that Greek of Paul in the epistles is not that good.  But, the Greek in Hebrews is amazing.  This hints, that if Paul were the writer someone else must have been his scribe.  This idea, resonates with me as I have found the Pauline epistles hard to read, but Hebrews has always been easier for me.  

The stylistic differences between English Hebrews and the Pauline letters are still apparent in the translation of KJV.

- Hebrews 2:5-8:  "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."

versus

- Romans 5:6-8: "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."

#### Direct Style of an epistle

In Hebrews, there is no direct address to a particular individual or community at the beginning of the letter. Instead, the author starts with a more general statement and sets the tone for a broader, more sermon-like message about the superiority of Christ.

- Hebrews 1:1-2: "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"

versus

- Pauline Epistle (Philippians 1:1): "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons."

#### Theory that Pauls is Dead

Scholars argue that the themes and concerns addressed in Hebrews, such as the role of the Old Covenant and the superiority of Christ, are different from those typically found in Paul's writings. This has led to speculation that the letter reflects developments in Christian theology that may have occurred after Paul's time.

Hebrews contains elements of hope in Jesus, it is primarily a theological and exhortative work, focusing on the superiority of Jesus and the New Covenant over the Old Covenant.  One of the key passages that highlights Jesus as the High Priest in the Book of Hebrews is found in Hebrews 4:14-16 (KJV):

- 14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

- 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

- 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

This passage emphasizes that Jesus is the "great high priest" who has a unique ability to sympathize with human weaknesses because He was also tempted in every way, yet He remained without sin. As the High Priest, He is a source of mercy and grace for believers, and they are encouraged to approach Him with confidence.
