### Hebrews and Orign

The authorship of the Book of Hebrews in the New Testament is a subject of debate and remains uncertain.  However,the King James bible says... "THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE HEBREWS".  

According to [James Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Goldberg) the entirety of the title page may be a lie [BYUTV Come Follow Up](https://www.byutv.org/0375bbf8-7020-48f7-80b6-d3a367d29163/come-follow-up-october-30-november-5-%7C-hebrews-1-6?player-open=true&content-id=0375bbf8-7020-48f7-80b6-d3a367d29163).   Perhaps you can speculate why?

#### Alternate writers

James Goldberg and ChatGPT specify there can be many authors... including Paul, Barnabas, Apollos, Priscilla, or an unknown early Christian figure. However, no conclusive evidence exists to definitively identify the author.

Priscilla being involved with her husband Aquilla is a romantic notion of intersts.  It also lines up with some scholars ideas that languages is different between "we" of Hebrews versus "I" in most epistles.

- Hebrews 2:3-4 "How shall <b>we</b> escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to <b>us</b> by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."

versus

- Philemon 1:8-9: "Accordingly, though <b>I</b> am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake <b>I</b> prefer to appeal to you."

#### Greek language

James Goldberg hints that Greek of Paul in the epistles is not that good.  But, the Greek in Hebrews is amazing.  This hints, that if Paul was involved he had the help of a scribe.  This idea, resonates with me as I have found the epistles hard to read, but Hebrews has always been easy for me.  The stylistic differences between Hebrews and the Pauline letters are still apparent in the KJV.

Hebrews 2:5-8:  "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."

versus

Romans 5:6-8: "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."

#### Direct Style of an epistle

In Hebrews, there is no direct address to a particular individual or community at the beginning of the letter. Instead, the author starts with a more general statement and sets the tone for a broader, more sermon-like message about the superiority of Christ.

Hebrews 1:1-2: "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world."

versus

Pauline Epistle (Philippians 1:1): "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons."

#### Theory that Pauls is Dead

One of the key passages that highlights Jesus as the High Priest in the Book of Hebrews is found in Hebrews 4:14-16 (ESV):

"Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."

This passage emphasizes that Jesus is the "great high priest" who has a unique ability to sympathize with human weaknesses because He was also tempted in every way, yet He remained without sin. As the High Priest, He is a source of mercy and grace for believers, and they are encouraged to approach Him with confidence
