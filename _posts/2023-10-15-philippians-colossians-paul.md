### Prophets and apostles—and all of us—strengthen and unify the Church

Conferences have come and passed in our day.   From Paul's declaration we understand with perfect clarity, the unique apostalic witnesses in The Churce of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[Come as you are ... but](https://youtu.be/cgq5yUgZUro?t=713)

Ephesians 2:19–22; 4:4–8, 11–16

12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

### We can find joy in Christ, regardless of our circumstances

Philippians 4:1–13

Verse 13: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

Greek: παντα ισχυω εν τω ενδυναμουντι με χριστω [panta ischuō en tō endunamounti me christō

endunamounti me = strengtheneth me = endows me with power

- Restructuring priorities

### We become “new” as we live the gospel of Jesus Christ

Philippians 2:1–5, 14–18; 4:1–9; Colossians 3:1–17... Colossians 3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

- Philippians 3:14-16.
- A formula about Saul to Paul.  These instructions are the next level of discipleship.  Philippians are faithful member.
  - Move Forward.   ... but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before
- Turn to Jesus.  ...  press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
- Think Celestial. ... Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you

### Works versus Grace

Ephesians 2:8-10
8 For by agrace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

10 For we are his aworkmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

2 Nephi 25:23
23 For we labor diligently to write, to apersuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can cdo.

### Christ makes us holy

IMO, Grace is our motto.  It is not healthy to have checklist for all the things we can do for Christ.  Here is my simple list, recognizing Christ as one who can make me holy ...

- Born Again. Make and renew covenants to be "born again" and "becoming his sons and daughters" Mosiah 27:25
- Sacrament prayers. Keep Jesus is with us, always remember him.
- Great Commandments. Love God, Love your fellow man.
- Think Celestial, keep the end in mind. Prophet Nelson.

### Armor of God

Philippians 4:8
We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men” (A of F 1:13).

Put on the full armor of God

Ephesians 6:10-18
Doctrine and Covenants 27:15-18

Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole darmor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to estand...

...and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be bcaught up, that where I am ye shall be also
