### Prophets and apostles—and all of us—strengthen and unify the Church

Conference have come and passed in our day.   From Paul we understand with perfect clarity, the unique apostalic witnesses in The Churce of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[Come as you are but don’t stay as you are](https://youtu.be/cgq5yUgZUro?t=713)

Ephesians 2:19–22; 4:4–8, 11–16

12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

### We can find joy in Christ, regardless of our circumstances

Philippians 4:1–13

Verse 13: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

- Restructuring priorities
- Feeling blessings after years of following
- Impactful feeling of The Saviors Atonement

### We become “new” as we live the gospel of Jesus Christ

Philippians 2:1–5, 14–18; 4:1–9; Colossians 3:1–17

Colossians 3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

- Philippians 3:14-16. Broken to new formula from Saul to Paul.  Man of these conversation are the next level of discipleship.  Philippians are faithful member.
  - Move Forward.   ... but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before
- Turn to Jesus.  ...  press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
- Think Celestial. ... Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you

### Works versus Grace

- Christ makes holy
- In the process Jesus is with us. Phillipians E 4:13 endumenti; Make covenants to feel close to the Lord
- Think Celestial
- Love God, love your fellow man

### Armor of God - Admonition of Paul

Ephesians 5:25–33; 6:1–4
Doctrine and Covenants 27:15-18
