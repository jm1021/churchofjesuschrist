The Savior used the scriptures both to resist Satan’s temptations and to testify of His own divine mission (see [Luke 4:1–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng&id=1-21#p1), [Matthew 4:1-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?lang=eng&id=1-17#p1), [JST Matthew 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/4?lang=eng)). ***Ponder how the scriptures can build your faith and your resolve to resist temptation***.
