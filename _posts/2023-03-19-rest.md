### "Rest" thougts by Michael McPhie
> The gospel is often associated with the word "Rest".  What is "Rest"?  All of of face crisis... Aging parents; wayward children; some kind of health crisis; depression or anxiety; mental health challenges; a crumbling marriage; family members struggling with addiction; loss of employment and the resulting financial crisis.  “Come unto me?”  Jesus was speaking to you and me; to our neighbors.  “Come unto me, ALL ye that labour and are heavy laden.” 

- Matthew [11:28–30](Matthew 11:28–30)

    28 ¶ Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and ***I will give you rest***.

    29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ***ye shall find rest unto your souls***.

    30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

## Upcomming [Holy Week](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/easter/holy-week)
> Soon it will be General Conference and then Easter.  All will happen before we meet in Sunday School.  As we read about Bethlehem at Chritmas, so should we read about Gethsemene, Golgatha, and Calvary at Easter.  Some of Jeus's greatest lessons were taught during this week.

Jesus Crist is the great Hope for us all!  That hope is now and forever!  When did you begin to believe?  What momement have you had to Yoke with the Savior.

- Alma 36

    18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.

    19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.

    20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous ***light I did behold***; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!


- 1 Corinthians 15

    22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

    55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

    56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

    57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the ***victory through our Lord Jesus Christ***.

    58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.


### Palm Sunday - This will be last day of General Conference
> On Palm Sunday, Jesus Christ made His ***triumphal entry*** into Jerusalem as His ***followers waved palm fronds*** and laid down cloaks in His path. They surrounded Jesus with love and praise, shouting “Hosanna”—a phrase meaning “save us.” Many of Jesus’s followers expected Him to save them from Roman rule, but His goals were more eternal. Jesus came to earth ***not to provide political deliverance but to save all humankind from sin and death***.

- [Entrance to the City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdUw_E-tGjE)

    - Matthew 21:7–11 Jesus enters the City

    7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.

    8 And a very great ***multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way***.

    9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, ***cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David***: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

    10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?

    11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

    - Luke 19:35–38

    35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

    36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

    37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, ***the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;***

    38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.


    - Comment.  The entrance to Jerusalem seems like a glorious day.   In a couple of week we will unite in conference, this feels like a series of ***days where we fellowhip and glory*** in the miracles of Jesus and the restoration of his gospel.

### Monday The Cleansing of the Temple - Most of us will be back to Work
> During Jesus’s time in Jerusalem, He visited the temple. ***There, inside His father’s house, Jesus saw various merchants doing business***. Jesus was appalled to see a place of worship being desecrated and turned into a “den of thieves” (Mark 11:17). Speaking with unmistakable authority, He commanded the merchants and moneychangers to leave.

- [Jesus overthrows Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyvTMggabJc)

    - Mark 11:15–18  House of Prayer

    15 ¶ And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to ***cast out them that sold and bought in the temple***, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;

    16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.

    17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations ***the house of prayer***? but ye have made it a den of thieves.

    - Comment. This is hard to comprehend how the Pharisees could let this happen with all the "rules" in the time.  Was it not written to seperate that which is holy?

### Tuesday Teachings
> In Jerusalem, Jesus was surrounded by supporters and critics alike. As the Master Teacher, He never let an opportunity to share His wisdom go to waste. ***During the last week of His life, He shared some of His most enduring teachings***. But His words weren’t intended only for the people present at the time. His teachings throughout His entire ministry can bless our lives, too. Watch some of His parables below

- [Ten Vigins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwCavwlkp0A)

- [Parable of the Talents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Havcr-2Kx30)

    - [Matthew 25:34–45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p34-p45#p34) - Ye have done it unto me

    40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, ***Inasmuch as ye have adone it unto one of the bleast of these my cbrethren, ye have done it unto me***.

### Wednesday The Greatest Commandments
> During His life on earth, Jesus Christ taught the importance of loving God and loving others.

- Matthwew 22

    “Thou shalt ***love the Lord thy God*** with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt ***love thy neighbour*** as thyself.” —Matthew 22:37–39 

    Jesus taught that the ***love of God and of our neighbor is the foundation of His gospel***. Near the end of His ministry, He expanded on this teaching when He taught: “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you. … ***By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples***, if ye have love one to another” (John 13:34–35). When we have love for one another, it’s easier to be like Jesus—we’re more patient, forgiving, and compassionate with the people around us.

### Thursday His Sacrifice Begins at Gethsemane
> Jesus observed the sacred holiday of Passover with His apostles. He ***instituted the sacred ordinance of the sacrament***, in which His disciples were invited to eat and drink in remembrance of Him. He taught them of the comforting power of the Holy Ghost. And, knowing that His time with them would soon end, He commanded them to love one another as He had loved them. That love, He said, would be a sign to others that they were His disciples.

- [Last Supper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=997ni1xcmKw)

    After what is often referred to as the Last Supper, Jesus bid His Apostles to follow Him through the night to a quiet garden named Gethsemane. Despite their Master asking them to stay awake with Him, the exhausted disciples fell asleep. Alone, Jesus began to pray and was soon overcome with incomprehensible agony. There ***in the Garden, He began the process of taking upon Himself the sins and pains of the world***. It was the beginning of an act of sacrifice that would reach its ultimate conclusion the next day on the cross at Golgotha.

- [Gethsemane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goR5FO1vge8)

    Later that night, Judas Iscariot betrayed the Savior to local authorities, who arrested Jesus and brought Him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest. There, Jesus would await His trial until the next morning.

    - Luke 22:14–20, 39-54
    - Matthew 26:36–57

### Friday The Crucifixion
> After a series of one-sided trials, Jesus Christ was sentenced to death by crucifixion. Roman soldiers mocked and scourged Him and nailed Him to the cross. But instead of condemning them, Jesus Christ begged His Father to “forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34). Even in His darkest moment, Jesus spoke of love and redemption. With His dying breath, Jesus addressed His Father. “It is finished,” He said (John 19:30). An unlikely testimony came from a Roman centurion and those who were with him: “Truly this was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). The realization is just as awe-inspiring today as it was then.

    - Matthew 26:59–75
    - Matthew 27:1–61

### Saturday The Tomb
> It’s hard to imagine the anguish Jesus Christ’s followers must have felt on the day after His death. The night before, His body had been lovingly prepared and placed in a garden tomb. Now they were left to figure out how life could possibly go on without Him. Almost certainly His death had taken something from them, but what they had lost was nothing compared to all that His life had given. Whether they understood it or not, Jesus Christ had forged a new path forward for all who would follow Him, one lit by a hope that shines brighter than any darkness we may encounter. 

- [Jesus laid in Tomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPfC9kSPP_Q)

    - John 14:15–16, 26–27
    - Matthew 27:55–61

### Sunday He is Risen
> Early in the morning, Mary Magdalene, a friend and follower of Jesus, came to the tomb to care for Jesus Christ’s body. To her astonishment, she found the tomb empty. Later, as she wept outside the tomb, a man addressed her—a gardener, she supposed. But then He said her name: “Mary.” And she saw. It was Jesus Christ, alive again. The knowledge was too wonderful to contain. Her faith propelled her into a joyous sprint as she ran to tell the others.

- [Mary Witnesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlKetn7ZiNU)

- [Mary Declares He Lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KCUs7oJxjc)

    It’s a testimony that still propels people today. You can know just as she did that Jesus Christ lives. Because of Him, everyone will live again. If we follow Christ, we can find true happiness on earth—and look forward to eternal joy in the life to come.

    - John 20:1–18
    - 1 Corinthians 15:20–22
