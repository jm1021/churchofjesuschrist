## Job “Yet Will I Trust in Him”
[Come Follow Me: Job 1–3; 12–14; 19; 21–24; 38–40; 42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-sunday-school-old-testament-2022/32?lang=eng) 

### ![img]({{site.baseurl}}/images/job_three_men_art.jpeg) Warm-Up activity is to recap the book Job, a life known for overcoming trials
> [Job 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=3#p2)... His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
- [Job 1:6-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=6-12#p6), according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat.  Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships.  After each hardship a messenger returns to say... "I only am escaped alone to tell thee".
- [Job 1:14-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/1?lang=eng&id=14-19#p13) the hardships start to happen.
    - 1st hardship ... The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword.
    - 2nd ... The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them.
    - 3rd ... The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword
    - 4th ... Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead.
- Job 2,41 is a whole bunch of poetry, lamenting, and praising. The highlight for me is [Job 19:25-26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/19?lang=eng&id=25-26#p24)
    - For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that che shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
    - And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God
- [Job 42:10,12-13,16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/42?lang=eng&id=10,12-13,16#9) the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
    - And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
    - So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
    - He had also seven sons and three daughters.
    - After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.
