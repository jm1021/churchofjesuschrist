## In times of suffering, we must trust the Lord. 
Why do terrible things happen to people who are trying to live righteously?

[Alma 13-16 Alma, Amulek, Zeezrom](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-home-and-church-book-of-mormon-2024/26?lang=eng)

### Terrible things passage
[Alma 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p8-p13#p8) And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; ...

Alma 14:9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.

Alma 14:10 ... How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.

Alma 14:11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; ...


### Examples of Sabre Springs loss
In recent times, in our own Sabre Springs Ward, we have lost some fine people to tragedy.  Flip through their lives.  Do you see tragedy, joy, or purpose?

These are people we have served with, worked with, and shared the words of redeeming love.  In my case, I can still hear their testimonies today.

## How long will we serve?
Often, at least for me, I look to put time limits on everything.  Mission 2 years, College 4 years, Kids 18 years, etc.

[Alma 17-22 Ammon, King Lamoni](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-home-and-church-book-of-mormon-2024/27?lang=eng)

### Ammon's declarations
Reading Ammon's perspective this time provided me with a new insight ...

[Alma 18:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p23-p25#p23)  ... Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.

Alma 18:25 ... Nay, but I will be thy servant.  ...


### What is retirement?
A few years ago, my choice was not to continue work in my 35-year career.  After a year of volunteering in the Temple, Wildwood Ranch, Red Cross, and San Diego HS ...   I decided to commit myself to teaching Computer Science.  Honestly, I don't know the duration, but I do know that my son should graduate in 3-years.

Today, I work with people in pictures.  It is Computer Science, instead of the gospel, but often I am in conversations like this from Bella... 

- "We were going through lessons each day with Bible Points (with verses from the New Testament). We had skits teaching kids about how God is a friend forever, God is a friend we can trust, God is a friend who is real, and God is a friend who loves us." 

- "I remember talking about how good things happen to bad people in my youth group! I think it is a joy to teach younger kids about God because they have a lot of wonder and hope."

## Born of God
As a people of believers, what stages of conversion do you recall that relate to the experience of the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi?

- We fear.  The Father of Lamoni has an interest in self-preservation.
[Alma 20:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)
I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom.

- We seek.  The Father of Lamon transforms from preservation to being born of God as he saw in Ammon.
[Alma 22:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)
I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.

- We praise Jesus.  Conversion of the Queen.  She turns her hope and mercy toward others.  This indicates her desire to share the fruit, in missionary work.
[Alma 19:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)
O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!

- We repent.  A change of heart occurs, impacting many cities of Laminites.  They change their lives, to unite their will with God
[Alma 23:6-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p6-p18#p6)

    6 ... and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.

    7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, ...

    16 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, ... that they might be distinguished.

    17 ... that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; ...

    18 And they began to be a very industrious people; ... and the curse of God did no more follow them.

- We continue in faith.  No matter how far removed from the support of others we can follow Jesus, Abish finally had the opportunity to share. [Alma 19:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p16-p17#p16) As Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father--- 17 ... she knew that it was the power of God; ... she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.
