## In times of suffering, we must trust the Lord. 
Why do terrible things happen to people who are trying to live righteously?

[Alma 13-16 Alma, Amulek, Zeezrom](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-home-and-church-book-of-mormon-2024/26?lang=eng)

### Terrible things passage
[Alma 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p8-p13#p8) And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; ...

Alma 14:9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.

Alma 14:10 ... How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.

Alma 14:11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; ...


### Examples of Sabre Springs loss
In recent times, in our own Sabre Springs Ward, we have lost some fine people to tragedy.  Flip through their lives.  Do you see tragedy, joy, or purpose?

These are people we have served with, worked with, and shared the words of redeeming love.  In my case, I can still hear their testimonies today.

## How long will we serve?
Often, at least for me, I look to put time limits on everything.  Mission 2 years, College 4 years, Kids 18 years, etc.

### Ammon's declarations
Reading Ammon's perspective this time provided me with a new insight ...

[Alma 18:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p23-p25#p23)  ... Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.

Alma 18:25 ... Nay, but I will be thy servant.  ...


### What is retirement?
A few years ago, my choice was not to continue work in my 35-year career.  After a year of volunteering in the Temple, Wildwood Ranch, Red Cross, and San Diego HS ...   I decided to commit myself to teaching Computer Science.  Honestly, I don't know the duration, but I do know that my son should graduate in 3-years.

Today, I work with people in pictures.  It is Computer Science, instead of the gospel, but often I am in conversations like this from Bella... 

- "We were going through lessons each day with Bible Points (with verses from the New Testament). We had skits teaching kids about how God is a friend forever, God is a friend we can trust, God is a friend who is real, and God is a friend who loves us." 

- "I remember talking about how good things happen to bad people in my youth group! I think it is a joy to teach younger kids about God because they have a lot of wonder and hope."
