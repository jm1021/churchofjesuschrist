## The Law (D&C 42)

In the presence of twelve elders and in fulfillment of the Lord’s promise previously made that the “law” would be given in Ohio.

### The Law to Preach

They, the Elders, are to teach and prophesy by the power of the Spirit;

4 Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this **first commandment, that ye shall go forth in my name**, every one of you, excepting my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.

5 And I give unto them a commandment that they shall go forth for a little season, and it shall be given by the power of the Spirit when they shall return.

6 And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.

11 Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be **ordained by some one who has authority**, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.

12 And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall **teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel**.

13 And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.

14 And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.

15 And all this ye shall observe to do as I have commanded concerning your teaching, until the fulness of my scriptures is given.

16 And **as ye shall lift up your voices by the Comforter, ye shall speak and prophesy** as seemeth me good;

17 For, behold, **the Comforter knoweth all things**, and beareth record of the Father and of the Son.

### The Law of Commandments

The Saints are commanded not to kill, steal, lie, lust, commit adultery, or speak evil against others;

18 And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.

19 And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die.

20 Thou shalt **not steal**; and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out.

21 Thou shalt **not lie**; he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out.

22 Thou shalt **love thy wife** with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.

23 And **he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith**, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.

24 Thou shalt **not commit adultery**; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out.

25 But he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive;

26 But if he doeth it again, he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out.

27 Thou shalt **not speak evil of thy neighbor**, nor do him any harm.

28 Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out.

29 **If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments**.


### The Law of Consecration

Laws governing the consecration of properties are set forth.

30 And behold, thou wilt **remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support** that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.

31 And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they **shall be laid before the bishop** of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose.

32 And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.

33 And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that **every man who has need may be amply supplied** and receive according to his wants.

34 Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;

35 And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed—

36 That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of my people.

37 And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out of the church, and shall not receive again that which he has consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my church, or in other words, unto me—

38 For inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto me.

39 For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled; for **I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people** who are of the house of Israel.

### Promises

The mysteries of the kingdom will be revealed.

61 If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive **revelation upon revelation**, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest **know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy**, that which bringeth life eternal.

65 Behold, thou shalt observe all these things, and great shall be thy reward; for unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but unto the world it is not given to know them.

66 Ye shall **observe the laws** which ye have received and be faithful.

67 And **ye shall hereafter receive church covenants**, such as shall be sufficient to establish you, both here and in the New Jerusalem.

68 Therefore, he that lacketh wisdom, **let him ask of me, and I will give him liberally and upbraid him not**.

69 Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the church have been given. Even so. Amen.
