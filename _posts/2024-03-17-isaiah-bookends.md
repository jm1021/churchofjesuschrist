## The Isaiah Chapter Bookends
General Conference is soon upon us.  The prophecies and path are forever being given line upon line until we reach a fullness, even Eternal Life.

In times of old Jacob and Nephi were providing prophetic teaching and guidance.  In three weeks, we will gather at the feet of Prophets and Apostles to listen to messages about Jesus, and guidance for us today.  

Oh the Wisdom of God that He has provided a plan from Generation to Generation.  Recently, I was in the Geneology Library with Sam Ng scrolling through his personal family history back 47 generations, the books of his tribes have yet to be revealed.  

But in that same era of 600 BC, we have been blessed to receive the Book of Mormon.

## Prophesy of a Marvelous Work and Wonder
The founding prophet, the leader of our generation, read and translated many miracles before the actual events occurred in his life. These events were revealed a result of Nephi and his ability to see and prophecy of on the works of Isaiah.   Joseph translated those work for us.

***Many generations from Isaiah, and Nephi, to Joseph Smith, are folded together in declaring the marvelous works of the Holy One of Israel***.

In the Lord's plan how He revealed a book from the dust of the earth, the Book of Mormon.  Also, noted many key and important things were sealed up, to be released in his own due time.   

***Reaffirming the principle of line-upon-line and precept-upon-precept***.  This unites us on the need for ongoing revelation, continued direction by Prophets, and ***conintuing to look toward God for further light and knowledge in the little things in our lives***.

### Prophesy in Isaiah 29
10 ***For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes***: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.

11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:

12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

13 ¶ Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and ***their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men***:

14 Therefore, behold, ***I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder***: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

18 ¶ And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

19 ***The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord***, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and ***they that murmured shall learn doctrine***.

### Words from Nephi 27

1 But, behold, ***in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles—yea***, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, ***they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations***

5 ***For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep***. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.

6 And it shall come to pass that ***the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book***, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.

9 But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, ***which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust***, and he shall deliver these words unto another;

11 And the day cometh that the words of ***the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ***; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.

12 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that ***the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses*** shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.

15 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.

17 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.

18 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.

19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned.

22 Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that ***I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things*** unto the children of men.

23 For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.

25 Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men—

26 Therefore, ***I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder***, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.

29 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.

30 ***And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the Lord***, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

34 But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

35 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and ***they that murmured shall learn doctrine***.

### The Three Witnesses
Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: ***That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi***, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. ***And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes***. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.
