## The Isaiah Chapter Bookends
General Conference is soon upon us.  The prophecies and path are forever being given line upon line until we reach a fullness, even Eternal Life.

In times of old Jacob and Nephi were providing prophetic teaching and guidance.  In three weeks, we will gather at the feet of Prophets and Apostles to listen to messages about Jesus, and guidance for us today.  

Oh the Wisdom of God that He has provided a plan from Generation to Generation.  Recently, I was in the Geneology Library with Sam Ng scrolling through his personal family history back 47 generations, the books of his tribes have yet to be revealed.  

But in that same era of 600 BC, we have been blessed to receive the Book of Mormon.
