## We Are Responsible for Our Own Learning
> Elder David A. Bednar taught: â€œ***We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us everything we need to know*** and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end.


### Transition away from Old Testament with Genealogies
> ***We all like to explore learning differently***.  These last few weeks, after a year of Old Testament study, and so many open questions about authors, dates, and theories of man ...  I have been very interested in date correlating genealogies in the Old and New Testament according to geological and sensational theorists.

> Abraham is probably the 1st figure in the Old Testament where the generational authors may have had stories that were told to them by living persons.

> Transitioning to the New Testament, we find the genealogies of Christ from Luke and Mathew.  These tell us how inaccurate records can be, when told by societies and authors over large periods of time.

> Geological dating of Younger Dryas dating and Mat layer seem to be lining up to 12,600 year ago.  This seems really plausible for Adam, particularly when you study bible theorists. Though pure biblical genealogies only takes us back 8,000 years ***But, none of this really matters***.   But, as we transition to biblical times we have authors recording events in their lifetimes; though most of them record 20 to 50 years after the events.
