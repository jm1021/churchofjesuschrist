## Captain Moroni's Epistles

Reference: [Alma 54:5-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p5-p14#p5); [Alma 60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng)

Captain Moroni is renowned for his passionate and direct letters, particularly those directed at Amalickiah and Pahoran. His epistles reflect a profound commitment to his people's freedom and a willingness to confront perceived threats to righteousness head-on.

However, modern readers might find his fervor almost too intense, perhaps even unsettling when considering today's more "inclusive" and "unity" approach. For example, his letter to Pahoran in Alma 60 is filled with frustration, accusations, and a call to action against perceived corruption. This reflects a deep zeal for righteousness, but in contemporary contexts, such a direct and confrontational tone might be seen as problematic or overly aggressive, likely leading to more negative responses or conflict rather than resolution.

Captain Moroni had to deal with a lot! How did he react when he heard about Pahoran and the rebellion at home?

As a missionary many years ago, we talked about "dusting your feet." Mob behavior can be in our own midst.

## Pahoran's Response

Reference: [Alma 61](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng)

Pahoran's response to Captain Moroni’s accusatory epistle sets a remarkable example of patience, humility, and forgiveness. Despite being wrongly accused by Moroni of neglect and betrayal, Pahoran responds with kindness and understanding, explaining the true situation of internal conflict he was facing.

For anyone struggling with feelings of anger or frustration—like road rage—Pahoran’s response serves as a standard of how to approach such situations with calm and grace. Rather than reacting with defensiveness or hostility, he diffuses the situation by providing context and maintaining a "spirit of unity".

Pahoran is instantly the reader's hero. However, some of the solutions to dissenters, such as capital punishment, could be perceived as over the top.

On the other hand, in many of the wars with the Lamanites, we hear of attackers throwing down arms and declaring an oath of peace to earn freedom.

I have heard many say that they can't believe in a God who had communities of people killed that opposed the Israelites. It seems like there were many alternate scriptural solutions to wars and rebellions in scriptures. Why?

## Stripling Warriors' Mothers

Reference: [Alma 56:47-48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p47-p48#p47)

The faith of the Stripling Warriors, a group of young, valiant soldiers, was indeed a direct reflection of the teachings and examples set by their mothers. These young men, described as having "never fought, yet they did not fear death," attributed their unwavering faith and courage to the assurances their mothers had given them that "God would deliver them." The influence of their mothers was so profound that it became a central theme in their success and survival in battle.

This story emphasizes the powerful role of righteous mothers in shaping the spiritual and moral fortitude of their children. Their example of faith and testimony provided a foundation that carried these young warriors through extreme challenges.

Some of us did not have mothers who were great role models. I was raised by a divorced mom who often prioritized her Hollywood lifestyle. However, there was typically something about my mom that seemed to appreciate my choice to follow what she termed as "Mormonism."

Others of us may sometimes feel like we fall short in our roles as mothers or fathers. Parenting, I have heard, "is the great experiment." How do you feel today about your parenting skills?

## Helaman and Descendants

Reference: Alma 53-58; [Helaman 5:4-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p4-p13#p4)

Helaman, who led the Stripling Warriors, is remembered not just for his leadership during their battles but also for his continued influence through his descendants. He guided the "little army" with faith and strategic wisdom, ensuring their preservation and success against overwhelming odds.

His descendants played crucial roles in the Reign of the Judges, facing significant challenges like political intrigue, bands of robbers, rejection of the prophets, and the pride and disbelief that plagued their society. Despite these challenges, they remained steadfast in their duties, embodying the same faith and leadership that Helaman had demonstrated.

In life, we may never know about the success or failure of our future generations. As I recall the teachings of my ancestors that I have researched through family history, I often feel a need to honor their past. I like how the Book of Mormon refers to King Benjamin, Amulek, and Zeezrom much later, after many generations. It gives me great hope for my future generations, through the traditions of Jesus Christ and the family values that I try to establish.

## Amalickiah, Ammoron, Gadianton

Amalickiah, Ammoron, Gadianton: Power, Greed, or Grievance?

Amalickiah, Ammoron, and Gadianton are often depicted as villains driven by power and greed. However, a closer examination of their actions and declarations reveals that they often claimed to be wronged, using these grievances to justify their actions.

## Amalickiah

Reference: [Alma 48:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1); [Alma 51:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/51?lang=eng&id=p8-p9#p8)

Amalickiah’s ambition to become king is clear, but he justified his actions by framing himself as a victim of Nephite leadership. After defecting to the Lamanites, he stirred up the Lamanites by convincing them that they had been wronged by the Nephites. He manipulated the situation to create a narrative of injustice, rallying support for his cause by claiming to be fighting against the oppression of the Nephite government.

### Ammoron

Reference: [Alma 54:16-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p16-p24#p16)

Ammoron, Amalickiah’s brother, continued this narrative of grievance. He sought to avenge the death of Amalickiah, which he portrayed as a grave injustice. His letters to Moroni reveal a deep-seated belief that the Nephites had wronged his people, using this as a justification for his war efforts.

### Gadianton

Reference: [Helaman 2:3-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/2?lang=eng&id=p3-p8#p3); [Helaman 6:18-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p18-p24#p18)

Gadianton, the leader of the Gadianton robbers, also framed his actions as a response to perceived injustices. The Gadianton robbers saw themselves as an oppressed group fighting against the Nephite society, which they viewed as corrupt and unjust. Their secret combinations were formed with the belief that they were reclaiming power and wealth that had been unfairly denied to them.

We have many groups in society that feel that they have a cause.   Many, believe as the Book of Mormon people that these wrongs have been for generations.  We have seen individuals like Ammon, service to King Limhi, that went to serve those that were considered potential enemies.  What is our call in this world of societies declaring they were wronged, for generations?

We may be quick to see all these "bad figures" as evil.   But, we may be "missing the people" behind the "bad people" that have good intentions.  Or, we may not see the "bad people" behind the "good people".  Do we think every German in WWII was bad?  Or do we think every Jew was good?

## Responding to Grievances

Reference: [Helaman 5:17-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p17-p19#p17)

The Book of Mormon offers examples of different approaches to dealing with those who feel wronged. For instance, Ammon’s service to King Lamoni and his people shows an approach of empathy and understanding, even toward those considered potential enemies. Instead of meeting hostility with hostility, Ammon’s approach was to serve and minister, which led to reconciliation and mutual respect.

Another example can be found in the story of Nephi and Lehi, the sons of Helaman. Nephi gave up his judgment seat to preach to the people, recognizing that their spiritual needs were greater than their political or judicial needs. They preached with great power and authority, converting many and bringing about peace through their Christlike example.

---

In today’s world, where many groups declare they have been wronged for generations, the example of Ammon and Nephi suggests that **our response should be rooted in empathy, understanding, and service**. Rather than dismissing these grievances, we are called to listen, serve, and seek reconciliation, just as they did. This doesn’t mean compromising on righteousness but rather finding ways to address grievances in a Christlike manner.
