<DIV ID="Householder" STYLE="display:none">
In the parable you described from Matthew 21:33-46, the householder represents God, the vineyard represents the kingdom of God, and the husbandmen represent the religious leaders or the people of Israel. The servants sent by the householder represent the prophets sent by God throughout history to the people of Israel, and the son represents Jesus Christ.
<br>
The phrase in Matthew 21:43, "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof," suggests a transfer of the blessings and responsibilities of the kingdom of God from the people of Israel (represented by the husbandmen) to another nation. This statement does not specifically mention any particular nation by name.
<br>
Interpretations of this parable may vary among theologians and scholars. Some speculate that the nation mentioned could refer to the early Christian Church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers. Others may interpret it more symbolically, suggesting that it represents the establishment and spread of Christianity throughout the world beyond the borders of Israel.
<br>
It is important to note that while the parable itself does not explicitly identify the nation to which the kingdom of God is given, it serves as a warning to the religious leaders of the time and emphasizes the rejection of Jesus, the Son of God, by the religious authorities.
<br>
Ultimately, the interpretation of this parable and the identification of the nation bringing forth the fruits thereof can vary among individuals and scholars, and it is advisable to consult various theological perspectives and teachings for a comprehensive understanding.
<br><br>
Can you find "theological perspectives" on this from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?
<br><br>
Certainly! The interpretation of the parable you mentioned, as viewed through the lens of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, can be found in the teachings of LDS Church leaders and scripture. Here are a few references that provide insights from a Latter-day Saint perspective:
<br>
"The House of Israel" and "the Gentiles": In LDS theology, the house of Israel represents the covenant people of God, which includes both the ancient Israelites and their descendants. The Gentiles refer to those who are not of the house of Israel. Latter-day Saint teachings often emphasize that the gathering of Israel and the spreading of the gospel are ongoing processes. The parable can be understood as a message that the blessings of the kingdom of God, including the gospel and priesthood authority, would be shared with people of all nations, both Israelite and Gentile.
<br>
Book of Mormon: The Book of Mormon, considered scripture by Latter-day Saints, contains additional teachings and interpretations of the parable. For example, 3 Nephi 16:10 states that if the Gentiles reject the fullness of the gospel, it will be taken from them and given to the remnants of the house of Israel. This concept aligns with the parable's message of the transfer of blessings and responsibilities.
<br>
Teachings of Church Leaders: Various talks and writings by LDS Church leaders offer insights into this parable. For instance, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a former Apostle of the LDS Church, addressed the parable in his book "The Mortal Messiah." He discussed how the rejection of Jesus and His gospel by the religious leaders led to the inclusion of the Gentiles in receiving the blessings of the kingdom.
<br>
It is important to note that individual interpretations and perspectives within the LDS Church may vary, and the official teachings of the Church are primarily found in its scriptures and statements from current Church leaders. Therefore, studying these sources can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the specific theological perspectives on this parable within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

### The two great commandments are to love God and love others as myself.
> [Matthew 22:34–40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?lang=eng&id=34-40#p34) 
- Loving God sometimes is the lessor discussed  - I would like to see if you can make an inference to our family humor.   In a family discussion we talked about Loving God.  In this discussion we talked about loving God in relation to commandments given to Moses, by our recollection we simply remembered "not to curse his name" and have  "no other gods".  This led to dialog about "Model Trains", "Computer Science" and "Korean TV Shows".  Can you determine why we drifted into that discussion?

<SCRIPT>
function NoOtherGods() {
    var x = document.getElementById('NoOtherGods');
    if (x.style.display == 'none') {
        x.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        x.style.display = 'none';

Based on the information you provided, it seems that your family discussion about loving God in relation to the commandments given to Moses took an unexpected and humorous turn, leading to a conversation about unrelated topics such as model trains, computer science, and Korean TV shows.
<br>
Humor often arises from unexpected connections or tangents in conversations. It's possible that someone in your family made a playful or humorous comment that sparked the discussion about these unrelated topics. The transition from discussing commandments to discussing seemingly unrelated hobbies and interests could be a lighthearted way of exploring the idea of what it means to love God in the context of various aspects of life, including personal hobbies and entertainment preferences.
<br>
In essence, the conversation may have taken a humorous detour to highlight the idea that even in our interests and hobbies, we can find ways to express love for God and see connections to our faith. Humor can often serve as a way to bring joy, creativity, and unexpected perspectives into discussions.
<br><br>
<b>2nd bit of Help to ChatGPT.</b> Close to the family event.  What if I provide you the hint to have "no other Gods" in relation to the humor?
<br><br>
If the hint is to have "no other Gods" in relation to the humor and the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV shows, it could be inferred that the humorous connection is centered around the idea of having a strong or intense interest in these topics.
<br>
The humor might stem from playfully exaggerating or jokingly suggesting that these hobbies or interests have become so important or captivating that they could be seen as competing with or taking the place of a person's devotion to God. In other words, the humorous implication could be that these topics or activities have become "gods" in a figurative sense, capturing a significant amount of attention or devotion.
<br>
This kind of humor often arises when people find amusing ways to juxtapose mundane or unrelated topics with significant or sacred concepts, highlighting the contrast between the two. It allows for a lighthearted exploration of the balance between our passions and our spiritual priorities, reminding us not to let our interests overshadow our love and devotion to God.
<br><br>
<b> Feedback on response to ChatGPT.</b>  Nicely done.  In dialog amongst the three off us Father said to Son, "Model Trains" is not a God.  Mother said to Father "Computer Science" is not a God.  Son said to Mother "Korean TV" is not a God.  We had a good laugh.  You were able to get to the inference very well.
<br>
Thank you! I'm glad I was able to accurately infer the humor in your family dialog. It sounds like a lighthearted and enjoyable moment, where the playfulness came from the contrast between the significance of having "no other Gods" and the humorous suggestion that these hobbies and interests were being treated as such.
<br>
Humor can often bring people together and create shared moments of joy and connection. It seems like your family found a playful way to explore the balance between their interests and their spiritual priorities, all while sharing some laughter together. Such moments can help strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.

### If I ask the Lord, He will teach me what I need to do to inherit eternal life
- In reading the story in the New Testament of the Rich Young Man, told three times Matthew 19:16–22; [Mark 10:17–22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10?lang=eng&id=17-22#p17); Luke 18:18–23.  Can you see how this relates to Model Trains, Computer Science, and Korean TV from our family story.

<BUTTON ONCLICK="RichYoungMan()">ChatGPT Response</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="RichYoungMan" STYLE="display:none">
The story you mentioned from the New Testament, often referred to as the story of the "Rich Young Ruler," can be found in Matthew 19:16–22, Mark 10:17–22, and Luke 18:18–23. This story involves a rich young man who approaches Jesus and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments, and the young man claims to have kept them since his youth. Jesus then instructs him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him, but the young man walks away saddened because he had great wealth.
<br>
In relating this story to the discussion about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV from your family story, we can draw some connections:
<br>
Model Trains: Just as the rich young man had possessions, including great wealth, model trains could be seen as a hobby or interest that involves material possessions. The story reminds us not to let our attachment to material things hinder our commitment to following Jesus.
<br>
Computer Science: Similarly, computer science or any other profession or area of expertise can be seen as something we dedicate our time and energy to. The story reminds us that our commitment to following Jesus should take precedence over any worldly pursuits or attachments, including our professional endeavors.
<br>
Korean TV: While Korean TV shows may not involve material possessions like model trains or a profession like computer science, the story highlights the importance of prioritizing our relationship with God over any personal interests or pleasures. It serves as a reminder that nothing should hinder our commitment to following Jesus, even if it means letting go of things that bring us enjoyment or entertainment.
<br>
In summary, the story of the Rich Young Ruler prompts us to examine our priorities and reminds us to put our devotion to God above worldly attachments, whether they are material possessions, personal interests, or professional pursuits.

<br><br>
<b>2nd question to ChatGPT.</b>  I like the Mark account the best.   Based off of my family story and our humor, do you see why I might like it?
<br><br>
Based on your family story and the humor you shared, I can see a possible connection between your preference for the Mark account of the story and the humorous dialogue about model trains, computer science, and Korean TV.
<br>
In the Mark account (Mark 10:17–22), the story of the Rich Young Ruler is presented in a concise and straightforward manner. It highlights the encounter between Jesus and the young man, emphasizing the young man's attachment to his possessions and his struggle to prioritize following Jesus over his wealth. This direct and succinct storytelling style might resonate with your preference for humor and concise communication.
<br>
Similarly, the humor in your family story involved playful and concise exchanges between family members, where the focus was on highlighting the contrast between personal interests or hobbies and the importance of spiritual devotion.
<br>
Your preference for the Mark account could stem from its brevity and clarity, aligning with the concise and playful communication style that you appreciated in your family's humorous dialogue.
<br>
Please note that this inference is based on the information provided, and individual preferences can vary.

<br><br>
<b>3rd question to ChatGPT.</b>  Do you see compassion or love in Mark account not seen in others?
<br><br>

In the Mark account of the story of the Rich Young Ruler, there is a notable emphasis on Jesus' response and his display of compassion and love towards the young man. After the young man expresses his desire to inherit eternal life and claims to have kept the commandments, Mark 10:21 states:
<br>
"Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, 'You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.'"
<br>
The inclusion of the phrase "Jesus, looking at him, loved him" highlights the compassion and care that Jesus felt towards the young man. This statement suggests that Jesus genuinely desired the young man to experience the blessings of eternal life and was willing to provide him with specific guidance and instructions to help him on that path.
<br>
While love and compassion are also present in the other Gospel accounts of this story (Matthew 19:16–22 and Luke 18:18–23), the Mark account explicitly mentions Jesus' love for the young man, providing a unique emphasis on the compassionate nature of Jesus' response.
<br>
This emphasis on Jesus' love and compassion in the Mark account could resonate with individuals who value and appreciate the deep care and understanding that Jesus demonstrated towards those seeking guidance and eternal life.

### The Laborers in the Vineyard
> [Matthew 20:1–16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20?lang=eng&id=1-16#p1) is a parable about a householder who went out to hire laborers in the Vineyard agreeing to pay them a penny a day.  The householder went out again at the 3rd, 6th, 9th hour and did likewise.  Finally, he went out at the 11th hour an questioned those who stood idle, he found out that no one hath hired them.  he hired laborers through the day, evensome at the 11th hour, every man receiving a penny.  Does anyone relate to this story, either by being and early hire or a late hire?

“My friends, I am not being unfair to you. You agreed on the wage for the day, a good wage. You were very happy to get the work, and I am very happy with the way you served. You are paid in full. Take your pay and enjoy the blessing.
<br>
May I plead with us not to be hurt—and certainly not to feel envious—when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon.
<br>
This parable—like all parables—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace.
<br>
So if you have made covenants, keep them. If you haven’t made them, make them. If you have made them and broken them, repent and repair them. It is never too late so long as the Master of the vineyard says there is time.

Now my tears accompanied his. Before me stood a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ who had given his all to teaching and testifying about the Savior. He was the embodiment of the healing and strengthening power of the Savior’s Atonement.
<br>

I said, “Danny! Have you looked in the mirror? Have you seen your eyes? They are filled with light, and you are beaming with the Spirit of the Lord. Of course you have been forgiven! You are amazing!
