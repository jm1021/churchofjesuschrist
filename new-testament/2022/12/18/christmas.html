<blockquote>
  <p>This Christmas season our hope and prayer is that each of us will feel the unconditional love of the Savior and recognize the precious eternal gift of His Atoning sacrifice.
Our desire as a Stake Presidency is that every member of our congregations will <strong><em>feel the power and influence of communion with God</em></strong>, that we may all know that we are His children and that we will personally feel His love. “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God” (Romans 8:16).
We invite all to create an atmosphere and opportunity to allow the spirit to bear witness that we are His children. We encourage all members to individually or as family, <strong><em>before leaving home to attend Christmas Day Sacrament service, to kneel in humble prayer and plead with God that He might touch our hearts with the realization that He loves us and that our hearts may be open to hear and receive His spirit</em></strong>.
Like the petition in the well-known Christmas Hymn “Away in a Manger” we might prayerfully ask,
    - Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
    - Close by me forever and love me I pray.
As you take these steps you will feel the Holy Spirit testifying of the divinity of Jesus Christ and will feel a closer connection to Him. You will give our Savior the gift that He seeks on Christmas Day – a closer relationship with Him.
We love you! We wish each of you a wonderful Christmas season, and especially a spiritual and uplifting Christmas Day as each of us draw nearer to the babe born in Bethlehem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine a time before knowing about a Savior.  Imagine challenges in life and not being able to lean on the Atonement.  In that journey <strong><em>people like us would likely be following a Faith and a Hope</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Old Testament carries a <strong><em>spirit of eager anticipation</em></strong>. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with <strong><em>hope for renewal and deliverance by the Messiah</em></strong>. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that <strong><em>a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come</em></strong> “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (Isaiah 61:1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <strong><em>hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born</em></strong> in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see Luke 2:7). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that <strong><em>with His stripes you can be healed (see Isaiah 53:4–5)</em></strong>. This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and <strong><em>He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him</em></strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Isaiah 53:4-5
4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p>Isaiah 61:1
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;</p>

<p>Luke 2:7
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>

<h3 id="merry-christmas">
<a class="anchor" href="#merry-christmas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Merry Christmas</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>How do you say <strong><em>Merry Christmas?</em></strong>  This week I was given a present with a Tree on it and said “Thank You” and “Merry Christmas”.   I was called out.  Christmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Even people who don’t worship Jesus as the Son of God can often feel the happiness of Christmas.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Return to your groups and talk about how you proclaim “Merry Christmas” with kindness, love, and respect.</li>
    <li>Talk about experiences or wisdom and words you say to invite and respect the season.</li>
  </ul>
