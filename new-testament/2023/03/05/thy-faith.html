  <p><strong><em>Hospitality</em></strong>, in Ancient Israel, was considered <strong><em>a very important virture</em></strong>. It was common to extend hospitality to travelers and guests.  It was also common for people to eat together in groups. <strong><em>Meals were often shared on low tables, with guest reclining on cushions or mats</em></strong>.  Reading from <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-hospitality/">My Jewish Learning</a> and from personal experience I believe that this customer continues in certain cultures …</p>

<p>Nov 11, 2007 email from John to Lora… BYU (campus) was closed, church was on Saturday.  I started <strong><em>walking at the top of Mount of Olives</em></strong>.  Found a really friendly man who <strong><em>invited me to his house</em></strong>.  There were all kinds of people living (or staying) there (socilaizing and passing through).  This was probably the highlight of my day but I was anxious to see the sites.</p>

<p>In retrospec March 2023, perhaps I should have lingered to better understand what it meant when <strong><em>Jesus sat to meat</em></strong>.  Enjoying meal and spending time with fellow travelers and the owner of the house.</p>

<h3 id="publicans-they-sat-down-to-meat">Publicans, They sat down to meat</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The term <strong><em>sat down to meat</em></strong> is an old-fashioned way to say <strong><em>they had a meal together</em></strong>.  The “meat” could refer to any type of food, not specifically animal flesh. There is something timeless about <strong><em>sharing a meal together and breaking bread</em></strong> with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mathew 9:9-13 A man named Mathew</p>

    <p>9 ¶ And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named <strong><em>Matthew</em></strong>, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</p>

    <p>10 ¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat <strong><em>in the house</em></strong>, behold, <strong><em>many publicans and sinners came</em></strong> and sat down with him and his disciples.</p>

    <p>11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?</p>

    <p>12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, <strong><em>They that be whole need not a physician</em></strong>, but they that are sick.</p>

    <p>13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, <strong><em>I will have mercy</em></strong>, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mark 2:13-17 He saw Levi</p>

    <p>14 And as he passed by, he saw <strong><em>Levi the son of Alphæus</em></strong> sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</p>

    <p>15 And it came to pass, that, as <strong><em>Jesus sat at meat in his house</em></strong>, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: <strong><em>for there were many, and they followed him</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that <strong><em>he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</em></strong></p>

    <p>17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, <strong><em>They that are whole have no need of the physician</em></strong>, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luke 5:27-32 All accounts mention the Publican and Follow me</p>

    <p>27 ¶ And after these things he went forth, <strong><em>and saw a publican, named Levi</em></strong>, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>

    <p>28 And <strong><em>he left all, rose up, and followed him</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>29 And <strong><em>Levi made him a great feast</em></strong> in his own house: and there was a <strong><em>great company of publicans</em></strong> and of others that sat down with them.</p>

    <p>30 But their scribes and <strong>*Pharisees murmured against his disciples</strong>, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</p>

    <p>31 And Jesus answering said unto them, <strong><em>They that are whole need not a physician</em></strong>; but they that are sick.</p>

    <p>32 <strong><em>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</em></strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pharisees-they-sat-down-to-meat">Pharisees, They sat down to meat</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Eating with Pharisees was <strong><em>breaking with social norms</em></strong> at the time.   Because of customs and the open nature of breaking bread  … <strong><em>A woman knew that Jesus was at the Pharisse’s house</em></strong> and brought an alabaster box.  She performed the act of washing Jesus’s feet, which is considered <strong><em>a sign humility and service</em></strong>.  This act was a powerfuls symbol of devotion and love … <strong><em>Jesus used this event to teach</em></strong>, which could be seen as a challenge to the Pharisee’s authourity.  Notice how he talks to <strong><em>Simon</em></strong>, this I believe is <strong><em>Simon</em></strong> the Pharisee.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Luke 7:36-50</p>

    <p>36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And <strong><em>he went into the Pharisee’s house</em></strong>, and sat down to meat.</p>

    <p>37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when <strong><em>she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house</em></strong>, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>

    <p>38 And <strong><em>stood at his feet behind him weeping</em></strong>, and began to <strong><em>wash his feet with tears</em></strong>, and did <strong><em>wipe them with the hairs</em></strong> of her head, and <strong><em>kissed his feet</em></strong>, and <strong><em>anointed them with the ointment</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>39 Now when the <strong><em>Pharisee</em></strong> which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for <strong><em>she is a sinner</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>40 And Jesus answering said unto him, <strong><em>Simon</em></strong>, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>

    <p>41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed <strong><em>five hundred pence</em></strong>, and the other <strong><em>fifty</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>

    <p>43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, <strong><em>to whom he forgave most</em></strong>. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>

    <p>44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto <strong><em>Simon</em></strong>, Seest thou this woman? <strong><em>I entered into thine house</em></strong>, thou gavest me <strong><em>no water</em></strong> for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>

    <p>45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>

    <p>46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>

    <p>47 Wherefore I say unto thee, <strong><em>Her sins, which are many, are forgiven</em></strong>; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p>

    <p>48 And he said unto her, <strong><em>Thy sins are forgiven</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>

    <p>50 And he said to the woman, <strong><em>Thy faith hath saved thee</em></strong>; go in peace.</p>
