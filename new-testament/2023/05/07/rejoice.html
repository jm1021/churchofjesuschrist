<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng">John 8:1-11</a> It seems to have profoundly impacted John as he wrote “And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.”, referring to Jesus.  As I read this story, writting on the ground impacted on me.  It helped me greatly with my own story, where I felt caught in the middle of two loved ones.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This story is about allowing only “family” to an upcoming “family reunion”.  This rule, I believe, is based off of our Patriarch for the reunion (pictured) likely using “The Family Proclamation” as his guide.  My daughter (also picture), who has a girlfriend,  wants to bring her to the reunion.
      <ul>
        <li>Regarding rule… “Claire I went to bat for you regarding reunion and failed. They only want their definition of family members on the reunion campus”</li>
        <li>My attempt at a Peacemaker statement… “Lora and I will pray for a change of heart”</li>
        <li>Support of Reunion and purpose… “In loving memory of Tamara I will still attend and try to honor her parents.”</li>
        <li>Clair’s Response… “I understand.  I was thinking…. Is there anyway you guys would be willing to pick me up on the way?”</li>
        <li>Summary… I was energized by this parable to take the proverbial time to “draw in the ground”.  The reading of the parable and the family discussion were synchronous in timing in my life.  In this event, I was so proud of Claire’s response.  It seemed Claire answered my prayers, while in my thought process I was focussed on my Father-in-Law from my deceased wife.  Though, we all know our family stories continue…  My prayers need to continue… Stay tuned for the post family reunion update.</li>

<p>On the Peter Nicholls story, I had two opportunities to find him in England 30+ years after we lost contact.  We attended Kings Lynn Ward as I brought a non-member from work.  We attended Peterboro Ward where he and one of my contemporary missionaries served in leadership callings.  About 4 years ago I found an old picture of him, I sent him a picture with caption “I found you Peter!”.  Though, on the totality of the experience, they found me.</p>

<p>5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</p>

<p>ChatGPT assistance…
The Parable of the Good Shepherd is a powerful and deeply symbolic image of Christ as our loving and protective shepherd who leads us to safety and salvation. While the parable can be understood on a literal level as a story about sheep and a shepherd, it also has several deeper meanings and interpretations.</p>

<p>One interpretation of the parable is that the sheep represent humanity and the shepherd represents Christ. The sheep who recognize and follow the shepherd’s voice represent those who have accepted Christ as their Savior and have a personal relationship with Him. The sheep who do not recognize the shepherd’s voice represent those who have not yet accepted Christ or who have strayed from the path of righteousness.</p>

<p>Another interpretation of the parable is that the shepherd represents the leadership of the Church, and the sheep represent the members of the Church. The parable emphasizes the importance of following the guidance and direction of Church leaders, who are called to be shepherds and watch over the spiritual well-being of the members.</p>

<p>The parable also emphasizes the love and care that the shepherd has for his sheep. Christ’s willingness to lay down his life for his sheep represents his ultimate sacrifice on the cross for the salvation of humanity. The parable also highlights the importance of each individual sheep, as the shepherd is willing to leave the 99 to search for and rescue the one lost sheep.</p>

<p>Overall, the Parable of the Good Shepherd is a powerful image of Christ’s love and care for his followers, and emphasizes the importance of following Christ and staying on the path of righteousness.</p>

<p>Lay up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.  This is interesting for me as I have completed my phase of accumulation, leading toward retirement.  Now my proverbial “treasures” are intended to take care of me, my wife and family for years to come.  Anyone have interesting interpretations on retirement savings?</p>

<p>ChatGPT assistance…
The Parable of the Foolish Rich Man is a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and materialism. The rich man in the story was so focused on accumulating wealth and enjoying his own pleasures that he neglected to consider the needs of others, and he ultimately lost everything.</p>

<p>In terms of modern interpretation regarding retirement, the parable can be seen as a warning against being overly focused on accumulating wealth and material possessions, and instead encourages a focus on investing in things that truly matter, such as relationships, experiences, and spiritual growth.</p>

<p>While saving for retirement is important, the parable suggests that our ultimate treasures should be things that are not subject to the uncertainties of life, such as a strong relationship with God and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This may mean investing time and resources into charitable causes or community involvement, rather than simply accumulating wealth for ourselves.</p>

<p>In addition, the parable emphasizes the importance of being prepared for unexpected events or emergencies, as the rich man was not prepared for his sudden death and lost everything. This can be interpreted as a call to be prudent in financial planning, and to have contingency plans in place for unexpected events.</p>

<p>Overall, the Parable of the Foolish Rich Man reminds us to keep our priorities in order, and to focus on investing in things that truly matter and bring lasting fulfillment, rather than being consumed by the pursuit of wealth and material possessions.</p>

</h3>
<p>No one is showing up to the supper, they all have an excuses.  Since I serve as a Missionary, sometimes I had this thought.  The key to story is probably that we attend the supper.  Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>ChatGPT assistance…
The Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14:12-24) tells the story of a man who throws a great banquet and invites many guests. However, when the time comes for the banquet, all of the guests make excuses and decline the invitation. The host becomes angry and sends his servant out into the streets to invite anyone and everyone to the banquet, regardless of their social standing. The servant returns with a diverse group of guests, and the banquet is a success.</p>

<p>The key message of the parable is that the invitation to the banquet represents the invitation to salvation and eternal life with God, and that many people will make excuses and refuse the invitation. The parable highlights the importance of accepting the invitation and responding to God’s call, and warns of the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ.</p>

<p>As a missionary, you may have encountered people who make excuses or refuse to consider the message of the gospel. The parable is a reminder that not everyone will respond positively to the invitation, and that rejection and indifference are common responses. However, the parable also offers hope in the form of the second group of guests who accept the invitation and enjoy the banquet. This group represents those who respond to the gospel message with faith and obedience, and who will ultimately be rewarded with eternal life.</p>

<p>Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of accepting God’s invitation to salvation and living a life of faith and obedience. It also highlights the dangers of making excuses and putting off the decision to follow Christ. As a missionary, you can share this message with others and invite them to accept the invitation to the great banquet of eternal life with God.</p>

</h3>
<p>A lesson in stewardship, “faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much”.</p>

<p>ChatGPT assistance…
Yes, the Parable of the Unjust Steward (Luke 16:1-12) is a well-known story told by Jesus. It’s a challenging parable that has been interpreted in a number of ways by scholars and theologians over the years.</p>

<p>In the parable, a rich man discovers that his steward (manager) has been squandering his possessions. The rich man calls the steward to account and tells him that he will be fired. The steward then goes to his master’s debtors and reduces the amount they owe in order to make friends for himself, perhaps hoping that these debtors will help him out when he loses his job.</p>

<p>Jesus concludes the parable by saying that the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted shrewdly. Jesus then goes on to say, “For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations” (Luke 16:8-9, KJV).</p>

<p>Many scholars interpret this parable as a lesson in shrewdness or wise use of resources. Jesus is not commending the steward for his dishonesty but rather for his shrewdness in using his remaining time and resources to prepare for the future. Jesus is urging his followers to use their resources wisely in order to prepare for their eternal destiny.</p>

<p>Other scholars interpret the parable as a lesson in stewardship, as you mentioned. Jesus is teaching that those who are faithful in small matters will also be faithful in larger ones. The steward was unfaithful in his management of his master’s possessions, but he was shrewd in using his remaining time to make amends. Jesus is urging his followers to be faithful and responsible in all areas of life, including the use of their resources and possessions.</p>

<p>Overall, the Parable of the Unjust Steward is a challenging story that requires careful interpretation. However, one clear message that emerges is the importance of wise use of resources and faithful stewardship in all areas of life.</p>

<p>Lazarus (a beggar) and the rich man die, there is a dialog with Father Abraham and Lazarus.  Interestingly, the rich man attempts to work up a plan to save his family.  Does this make us think there is hope for rich man?  Was Jesus hinting at this?</p>

<p>ChatGPT assistance…
In the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), the rich man and Lazarus die, and their fates in the afterlife are drastically different. Lazarus is carried by the angels to Abraham’s side, while the rich man is tormented in Hades. In the dialogue between the rich man and Abraham, the rich man pleads for mercy and relief from his torment, and he also asks Abraham to send Lazarus to his father’s house to warn his five brothers so they will not end up in the same place of torment.</p>

<p>The fact that the rich man is concerned for his family members and their fate suggests that he is not entirely without compassion or concern for others. However, the parable does not offer any explicit indication of the rich man’s spiritual state or his ultimate fate. It’s possible that Jesus included this detail to emphasize the importance of warning others about the reality of judgment and eternal consequences. The rich man’s concern for his brothers may be seen as a reminder that we should also be concerned about the spiritual welfare of those around us.</p>

<p>Overall, the parable emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and caring for those who are in need. While it’s possible to interpret the rich man’s concern for his family as a sign of hope for his salvation, the parable does not provide a clear answer on the matter. Ultimately, the parable serves as a warning about the reality of judgment and the importance of living a life that reflects our faith and commitment to God.</p>
